Anything\nthrown up falls down towards the earth, going uphill is lot\nmore tiring than going downhill, raindrops from the clouds\nabove fall towards the earth and  there are many other such\nphenomena.  Historically it was the Italian Physicist Galileo\n(1564-1642) who recognised the fact that all bodies,\nirrespective of their masses, are accelerated towards the earth\nwith a constant acceleration.  It is said  that he made a public\ndemonstration of this fact.  To find the truth, he certainly\ndid experiments with bodies rolling down inclined planes and\narrived at a value of the acceleration due to gravity which is\nclose to the more accurate value obtained later.\nA seemingly unrelated phenomenon, observation of stars,\nplanets and their motion has been the subject of attention\nin many countries since the earliest of times.  Observations\nsince early times recognised stars which appeared in the\nsky with positions unchanged year after year .  The more\ninteresting objects are the planets which seem to have regular\nmotions against the background of stars.  The earliest\nrecorded model for planetary motions proposed by Ptolemy\nabout 2000 years ago was a \u2018geocentric\u2019 model in which all\ncelestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets, all revolved\naround the earth.

The ellipse, of\nwhich the circle is a special case, is a closed\ncurve which can be drawn very simply as\nfollows.\nSelect two points F 1 and F2.  Take a length\nof a string and  fix its ends at F 1 and F 2 by\npins.  With the tip of a pencil  stretch the string\ntaut and then draw a curve by moving the\npencil keeping the string taut throughout.(Fig.\n7.1(b))  The closed curve you get is called an\nellipse. Clearly for any point T on the ellipse,\nthe sum of the distances from F 1 and F 2 is a\nconstant.  F 1, F2 are called the focii. Join the\npoints F 1 and  F2  and extend   the line to\nintersect the ellipse at points P and A as shown\nin Fig. 7.1(b). The midpoint of the line PA is\nthe centre of the ellipse O and the length PO =\nAO  is called the semi-major axis of the ellipse.\nFor a circle, the two focii  merge into one  and\nthe semi-major axis becomes the radius of the\ncircle.\n2. Law of areas : The line that joins any planet\nto the sun sweeps  equal areas in equal\nintervals of time (Fig. 7.2).

A natural\nquery that arises in our mind is the following:\n\u2018can we throw an object with such high initial\nspeeds that it does not fall back to the earth?\u2019\nThe principle of conservation of energy helps\nus to answer this question. Suppose the object\ndid reach infinity and that its speed ther e was\nVf . The energy of an object is the sum of potential\nand kinetic energy.

Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force of attraction between\nany two particles of masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance r has the magnitude\nF G\nm m\nr2= 1 2\nwhere G is the universal gravitational constant, which has the value  6.672\u00d710\u201311 N m2 kg\u20132.\n2. If we have to find the resultant gravitational force acting on the particle m due to a number of\nmasses M1, M2, \u2026.Mn etc. we use the principle of superposition. Let F1, F2, \u2026.Fn be the individual\nforces due to M1, M2, \u2026.Mn, each given by the law of gravitation. From the principle of superposition\neach force acts independently  and uninfluenced by the other bodies. The resultant force FR is\nthen found by vector addition\nFR  =  F1 + F2 + \u2026\u2026+ Fn   =  \nFi\ni\nn\n=\n\u2211\n1\nwhere the symbol \u2018\u03a3\u2019 stands for summation.\n3.

A farmer ploughing the field, a\nconstruction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for\na competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful\nlandscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however ,\nthe word \u2018W ork\u2019 cover s a definite  and precise meaning.\nSomebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a\nday is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a\nlong distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is\nthus our capacity to do work. In Physics too, the term \u2018energy\u2019\nis related to work in this sense, but as said above the term\n\u2018work\u2019 itself is defined much more precisely. The word \u2018power\u2019\nis used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In\nkarate or boxing we talk of \u2018powerful\u2019 punches. These are\ndelivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to\nthe meaning of the wor d \u2018power\u2019 used in physics.  We shall\nfind that there is at best a loose correlation betwee n the\nphysical definitions and the physiological pictures these\nterms generate in our minds.  The aim of this chapter is to\ndevelop an understanding of these three physical quantities.\nBefore we proceed to this task, we need to develop a\nmathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two\nvectors.\n5.1.1 The Scalar Product\nWe have lear nt about vectors and their use in Chapter 3.",

Thus,\nwhen you push hard against a rigid brick wall,\nthe force you exert on the wall does no work.

The three-dimensional\ngeneralisation requires the use of a vector\nderivative, which is outside the scope of this\nbook.\nl The work done by the conservative for ce\ndepends only on the end points. This can be\nseen from the relation,\nW = Kf \u2013 K i = V (xi ) \u2013 V(xf )\nwhich depends on the end points.\nl A third definition states that the work done\nby this force in a closed path is zero.  This is\nonce  again apparent from Eq. (5.11) since\nxi  = xf .\nThus, the principle of conservation of total\nmechanical energy can be stated as",

The spring is light\nand may be tr eated as massless.  In an ideal\nspring, the spring for ce Fs  is pr oportional to\nx where x  is the displacement of the block from\nthe equilibrium position. The displacement could\nbe either positive [Fig. 5.7(b)] or negative\n[Fig. 5.7(c)].  This force law for the spring is called\nHooke\u2019s law and is mathematically stated as\nFs =  \u2212 kx\nThe constant k is called the spring constant.  Its\nunit is N m-1.  The spring is said to be stiff if k\n is\nlarge and soft if k is small.\nSuppose that we pull the block outwards as in\nFig. 5.7(b).

When two objects\ncollide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over\nthe collision time \u2206t cause a change in their\nrespective momenta :\n\u2206p1 \n= F12  \u2206t\n\u2206p2 = F21  \u2206t\nwhere F12 is  the force exerted on the first particle\nby the second particle. F21 is likewise the force\nexerted on the second particle by the first particle.\nNow from Newton\u2019s third law, F12 = \u2212 F21.  This\nimplies\n\u2206p1 +\n \u2206p2 =  0\nThe above conclusion is true even though the\nforces vary in a complex fashion during the\ncollision time \u2206t. Since the third law is true at\nevery instant, the total impulse on the first object\nis equal and opposite to that on the second.\nOn the other hand, the total kinetic energy of\nthe system is not necessarily conserved. The\nimpact and deformation during collision may\ngenerate heat and sound. Part of the initial kinetic\nenergy is transformed into other forms of energy.\nA useful way to visualise the deformation during\ncollision is in terms of a \u2018compressed spring\u2019. If\nthe \u2018spring\u2019 connecting the two masses regains\nits original shape without loss in energy , then\nthe initial kinetic energy is equal to the final\nkinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the\ncollision time \u2206t is not constant.

W e saw that\nuniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas\nnon-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in\naddition.  So far, we have not asked the question as to what\ngoverns the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this\nbasic question.\nLet us first guess the answer based on our common\nexperience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it.\nTo throw a stone upwards, one has to  give it an upward\npush.  A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a\nstrong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a\nflowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external\nagency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest.\nLikewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop\nmotion.  You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by\napplying a force against the direction of its motion.\nIn these examples, the external agency of force (hands,\nwind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not\nalways necessary. A stone released from the top of a building\naccelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the\nearth.  A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance.\nThis shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and\nmagnetic forces )  can exert  force on a body even from a\ndistance.\nIn short, a force is required to put a stationary body in",

Indeed, the\ncorrect answer to this question given by Galileo\nin the seventeenth century was the foundation\nof Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the\nbirth of modern science.\nThe Greek thinker,  Aristotle (384 B.C\u2013 322\nB.C.), held the view that if a body is moving,\nsomething external is required to keep it moving.\nAccording to this view, for example, an arrow\nshot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind\nthe arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of\nan elaborate framework of ideas developed by\nAristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe.\nMost of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now\nknown to be wrong and need not concern us.\nFor our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of\nmotion may be phrased thus: An external force\nis required  to keep a body in motion.\nAristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall\nsee.  However, it is a natural view that anyone\nwould hold from common experience. Even a\nsmall child playing with a simple (non-electric)\ntoy-car on a floor knows intuitively that it needs\nto constantly drag the string attached to the toy-\ncar with some force to keep it going.  If it releases\nthe string, it comes to rest. This experience is\ncommon to most terrestrial motion. External\nforces seem to be needed to keep bodies in\nmotion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually\ncome to rest.\nWhat is the flaw in Aristotle\u2019s argument? The",

The\nanswer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because\nthe external force of friction on the car by the floor\nopposes its motion. To counter this force, the child\nhas to apply an external force on the car in the\ndirection of motion.  When the car is in uniform\nmotion, there is no net external force acting on it:\nthe force by the child cancels the force ( friction)\nby the floor.  The corollary is: if there were no friction,\nthe child would not be required to apply any force\nto keep the toy car in uniform motion.\nThe opposing forces such as friction (solids)\nand viscous forces (for fluids) are always present\nin the natural world.  This explains why forces\nby external agencies are necessary to overcome\nthe frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform\nmotion. Now we understand  where Aristotle\nwent wrong.  He coded this practical experience\nin the form of a basic argument.  To get at the\ntrue law of nature for forces and motion, one has\nto imagine a world in which uniform motion is\npossible with no frictional forces opposing. This\nis what Galileo did.\n4.3  THE LAW OF INERTIA\nGalileo studied motion of objects on an inclined\nplane.

However, if there\nwere no friction, the ball would continue  to move\nwith a constant velocity on the horizontal plane.\nGalileo thus, arrived at a new insight on\nmotion that had eluded Aristotle and those who\nfollowed him.  The state of rest and the state of\nuniform linear motion (motion with constant\nvelocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is\nno net force acting on the body.  It is incorrect to\nassume that a net force is needed to keep a body\nin uniform motion. To maintain a body in\nuniform motion, we need to apply an external\nforce to ecounter the frictional force, so that\nthe two forces sum up to zero net external\nforce.\nTo summarise, if the net external force is zero,\na body at rest continues to remain at rest and a\nbody in motion continues to move with a uniform\nvelocity.  This property of the body is called\ninertia.

Force, the cause of\nmotion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force\nof wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potter\u2019s rod strikes the wheel; persistent\ntendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body;\ntransmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps\ncomes closest to the concept of inertia.  Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to\nbe opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air\nresistance.  It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational\nand vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent\nparticles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole (patan) and also rotational\nand vibrational motion (bhraman, spandan), but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a\ndefinite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of\nmotion and units of length and time.

As\nyou may have noticed, he draws in the hands\nbackward in the act of catching the ball\n(Fig. 4.3).  The novice, on the other hand,\nkeeps his hands fixed and tries to catch the\nball almost instantly. He needs to provide a\nmuch greater force to stop the ball instantly,\nand this hurts.  The conclusion is clear: force\nnot only depends on the change in momentum,\nbut also on how fast the change is brought\nabout.  The same change in momentum\nbrought about in a shorter time needs a\ngreater applied force. In short, the greater the\nrate of change of momentum, the greater is\nthe force.\nFig. 4.3 Force not only depends on the change in\nmomentum but also on how fast the change\nis brought about. A seasoned cricketer draws\nin his hands during a catch, allowing greater\ntime for the ball to stop and hence requires a\nsmaller force.\n\u2022 Observations confirm that the product of\nmass and velocity (i.e. momentum) is basic to\nthe effect of force on motion.

Suppose a\nstone is rotated with uniform speed in a\nhorizontal plane by means of a string, the\nmagnitude of momentum is fixed, but its\ndirection changes (Fig. 4.4).

But what if the bodies\nare not in contact ?  The earth pulls a stone\ndownwards due to gravity.  Does the stone exert\na force on the earth ?  The answer is not obvious\nsince we hardly see the effect of the stone on the\nearth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes,\nthe stone does exert an equal and opposite force\non the earth. We do not notice it since the earth\nis very massive and the effect of a small force on\nits motion is negligible.\nThus, according to Newtonian mechanics,\nforce never occurs singly in nature. Force is the\nmutual interaction between two bodies.  Forces\nalways occur in pairs. Further, the mutual forces\nbetween two bodies are always equal and\nopposite.  This idea was expressed by Newton in\nthe form of the third law of motion.\nTo every action, there is always an equal and\nopposite reaction.\nNewton\u2019s wording of the third law is so crisp and\nbeautiful that it has become a part of common\nlanguage. For the same reason perhaps,\nmisconceptions about the third law abound.  Let\nus note some important points about the third\nlaw, particularly in regard to the usage of the\nterms : action and reaction.\n1. The terms action and reaction in the third law",

Using different\nterms for the same physical concept\ncan sometimes be confusing. A simple\nand clear way of stating the third law is as\nfollows:\nForces always occur in pairs.  Force on a\nbody A by B is equal and opposite to the\nforce on the body B by A.\n2. The terms action and reaction in the third law\nmay give a wrong impression that action\ncomes before reaction i.e action is the cause\nand reaction the effect. There is no cause-\neffect relation implied in the third law.  The\nforce on A by B and the force on B by A act\nat the same instant.  By the same reasoning,\nany one of them may be called action and the\nother reaction.\n3. Action and reaction forces act on different\nbodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair\nof bodies A and B.  According to the third law,\nFAB  =  \u2013 FBA  (4.8)\n(force on A by B)  =  \u2013 (force on B by A)\nThus if we are considering the motion of any\none body (A or B), only one of the two forces is\nrelevant.  It is an error to add up the two forces\nand claim that the net force is zero.\nHowever, if you are considering the system\nof two bodies as a whole, FAB and FBA are\ninternal forces of the system (A + B). They add\nup to give a null force. Internal forces in a\nbody or a system of particles thus cancel away\nReprint 2025-26",

When bodies are in\ncontact (e.g.  a book resting on a table, a system\nof rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and\nother types of supports), there are mutual\ncontact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying\nthe third law.

Contact\nforces arise also when solids are in contact with\nfluids.  For example, for a solid immersed in a\nfluid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to\nthe weight of the fluid displaced. The viscous\nforce, air resistance, etc are also examples of\ncontact forces (Fig. 4.9).\nTwo other common forces are tension in a\nstring and the force due to spring. When a spring\nis compressed or extended by an external force,\na restoring force is generated. This force is\nusually proportional to the compression or\nelongation (for small displacements).

Yet they are very useful in\npractical calculations in mechanics.\nThus, when two bodies are in contact, each\nexperiences a contact force by the other. Friction,\nby definition, is the component of the contact force\nparallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes\nimpending or actual relative motion between the\ntwo surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but\nrelative motion that the frictional force opposes.\nConsider a box lying in the compartment of a train\nthat is accelerating.  If the box is stationary\nrelative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along\nwith the train. What forces cause the acceleration\nof the box?  Clearly, the only conceivable force in\nthe horizontal direction is the force of friction. If\nthere were no friction, the floor of the train would\nslip by and the box would remain at its initial\nposition due to inertia (and hit the back side of\nthe train). This impending relative motion is\nopposed by the static friction fs. Static friction\nprovides the same acceleration to the box as that\nof the train, keeping it stationary relative to the\ntrain.\nExample 4.7 Determine the maximum\nacceleration of the train in which a box\nlying on its floor will remain stationary,\ngiven that the co-efficient of static friction\nbetween the box and the train\u2019s floor is\n0.15.\nAnswer  Since the acceleration of the box is due\nto the static friction,\nma  =  fs \u2264 \n\u00b5s N  =  \u00b5s  m g\ni.e.   a  \u2264  \u00b5s g\n\u2234  amax =  \u00b5s g  = 0.15  x 10 m s\u20132",

Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit \n\u00b5s N (fs \u2264 \u00b5s N).  Do not put\nfs= \u00b5s N  without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming\ninto play.\n7. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in\nequilibrium.  The two forces mg and R can be different (e.g. a body in an\naccelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third\nlaw.\n8. The terms \u2018action\u2019 and \u2018reaction\u2019 in the third Law of Motion simply stand for\nsimultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in\nordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction.  Action and reaction\nact on different bodies.\n9. The different terms like \u2018friction\u2019, \u2018normal reaction\u2019 \u2018tension\u2019, \u2018air resistance\u2019,\n\u2018viscous drag\u2019, \u2018thrust\u2019, \u2018buoyancy\u2019, \u2018weight\u2019, \u2018centripetal force\u2019 all stand for \u2018force\u2019\nin different contexts.  For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms\nencountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase \u2018force on A by B\u2019.\n10.

The overall dimensions of a nucleus are much smaller\nthan those of an atom. Experiments on scattering of a-particles\ndemonstrated that the radius of a nucleus was smaller than the radius\nof an atom by a factor of about 104. This means the volume of a nucleus\nis about 10\u201312  times the volume of the atom. In other words, an atom is\nalmost empty. If an atom is enlarged to the size of a classroom, the nucleus\nwould be of the size of pinhead. Nevertheless, the nucleus contains most\n(more than 99.9%) of the mass of an atom.\nDoes the nucleus have a structure, just as the atom does?  If so, what\nare the constituents of the nucleus?  How are these held together? In this\nchapter, we shall look for answers to such questions. We shall discuss\nvarious properties of nuclei such as their size, mass and stability, and\nalso associated nuclear phenomena such as radioactivity, fission and fusion.\n13.2  ATOMIC MASSES AND COMPOSITION OF NUCLEUS\nThe mass of an atom is very small, compared to a kilogram;  for example,\nthe mass of a carbon atom, 12C, is 1.992647 \u00d7 10\u201326 kg.

But the masses of the nuclei of\nhydrogen, deuterium and tritium are in the ratio of 1:2:3.  Therefore, the\nnuclei of deuterium and tritium must contain,  in addition to a proton,\nsome neutral matter.

This fact indicates that the nuclei of\natoms contain, in addition to protons, neutral matter in multiples of a\nbasic unit.  This hypothesis was verified in 1932 by James Chadwick\nwho observed emission of neutral radiation when beryllium nuclei were\nbombarded with alpha-particles (\na-particles are helium nuclei, to be\ndiscussed in a later section). It was found that this neutral radiation\ncould knock out protons from light nuclei such as those of helium, carbon\nand nitrogen.

From conservation of energy and momentum,\nhe was able to determine the mass of new particle \u2018as very nearly the\nsame as mass of proton\u2019.\nThe mass of a neutron is now known to a high degree of accuracy.

It decays into a\nproton, an electron and a antineutrino (another elementary particle), and\nhas a mean life of about 1000s.  It is, however, stable inside the nucleus.\nThe composition of a nucleus can now be described using the following\nterms and symbols:\nZ - atomic number = number of protons [13.4(a)]\nN - neutron number = number of neutrons [13.4(b)]\nA - mass number = Z + N\n                              = total number of protons and neutrons[13.4(c)]\nOne also uses the term nucleon for a proton or a neutron.

The nuclei of isotopes of a given element contain the same\nnumber of protons, but differ from each other in their number of neutrons.\nDeuterium, 2\n1 H, which is an isotope of hydrogen, contains one proton\nand one neutron.  Its other isotope tritium, 3\n1 H, contains one proton and\ntwo neutrons.  The element gold has 32 isotopes, ranging from A =173 to\nA = 204.  We have already mentioned that chemical properties of elements\ndepend on their electronic structure.  As the atoms of isotopes have\nidentical electronic structure they have identical chemical behaviour and\nare placed in the same location in the periodic table.\nAll nuclides with same mass number A are called isobars.  For\nexample, the nuclides 3\n1 H and 3\n2 He  are isobars.  Nuclides with same\nneutron number N but different atomic number Z, for example 198\n80 Hg\nand 197\n79 Au, are called isotones.\n13.3  SIZE OF THE NUCLEUS\nAs we have seen in Chapter 12, Rutherford was the pioneer who\npostulated and established the existence of the atomic nucleus.

We have already seen\nthat the constancy of binding energy per nucleon can be\nunderstood in terms of its short-range. Many features of the\nnuclear binding force are summarised below. These are\nobtained from a variety of experiments carried out during 1930\nto 1950.\n(i) The nuclear force is much stronger than the Coulomb force\nacting between charges or the gravitational forces between\nmasses. The nuclear binding force has to dominate over\nthe Coulomb repulsive force between protons inside the\nnucleus. This happens only because the nuclear force is\nmuch stronger than the coulomb force. The gravitational\nforce is much weaker  than even Coulomb force.\n(ii) The nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to\nzero as their distance is more than a few femtometres. This\nleads to saturation of forces in a medium or a large-sized\nnucleus, which is the reason for the constancy of the\nbinding energy per nucleon.\nA rough plot of the potential energy between two nucleons\nas a function of distance is shown in the Fig. 13.2. The\npotential energy is a minimum at a distance r0 of about\n0.8 fm. This means that the force is attractive for distances larger\nthan 0.8 fm and repulsive if they are separated by distances less\nthan 0.8 fm.\nFIGURE 13.2 Potential energy\nof a pair of nucleons as a\nfunction of their separation.\nFor a separation greater\nthan r0, the force is attractive",

The energy\nreleased or absorbed in a chemical reaction can be traced to the\ndifference in chemical (not nuclear) binding energies of atoms\nand molecules on the two sides of a reaction. Since, strictly\nspeaking, chemical binding energy also gives a negative\ncontribution (mass defect) to the total mass of an atom or molecule,\nwe can equally well say that the difference in the total mass of\natoms or molecules, on the two sides of the chemical reaction\ngets converted into ener gy or vice-versa. However , the mass\ndefects involved in a chemical reaction are almost a million times\nsmaller than those in a nuclear reaction.This is the reason for\nthe general impression, (which is incorrec t) that mass-energy\ninterconversion does not take place in a chemical reaction.\nSUMMARY\n1.

The radius of a nucleus determined by electron scattering is found to\nbe slightly different from that determined by alpha-particle scattering.\nThis is because electron scattering senses the charge distribution of\nthe nucleus, whereas alpha and similar particles sense the nuclear\nmatter.\n3. After Einstein showed the equivalence of mass and energy, E = mc2,\nwe cannot any longer speak of separate laws of conservation of mass\nand conservation of energy, but we have to speak of a unified law of\nconservation of mass and energy. The most convincing evidence that\nthis principle operates in nature comes from nuclear physics. It is\ncentral to our understanding of nuclear energy and harnessing it as a\nsource of power. Using the principle, Q of a nuclear process (decay or\nreaction) can be expressed also in terms of initial and final masses.\n4. The nature of the binding energy (per nucleon) curve shows that\nexothermic nuclear reactions are possible, when two light nuclei fuse\nor when a heavy nucleus undergoes fission into nuclei with intermediate\nmass.\n5. For fusion, the light nuclei must have sufficient initial energy to\novercome the coulomb potential barrier . That is why fusion r equires\nvery high temperatures.\n6.

In 1897, the experiments on electric discharge\nthrough gases carried out by the English physicist J. J. Thomson (1856 \u2013\n1940) revealed that atoms of different elements contain negatively charged\nconstituents (electrons) that are identical for all atoms. However, atoms on a\nwhole are electrically neutral. Therefore, an atom must also contain some\npositive charge to neutralise the negative charge of the electrons. But what\nis the arrangement of the positive charge and the electrons inside the atom?\nIn other words, what is the structure of an atom?\nThe first model of atom was proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1898.\nAccording to this model, the positive charge of the atom is uniformly\ndistributed throughout the volume of the atom and the negatively charged\nelectrons are embedded in it like seeds in a watermelon. This model was\npicturesquely called plum pudding model  of the atom. However\nsubsequent studies on atoms, as described in this chapter, showed that\nthe distribution of the electrons and positive charges are very different\nfrom that proposed in this model.\nWe know that condensed matter (solids and liquids) and dense gases at\nall temperatures emit electromagnetic radiation in which a continuous\ndistribution of several wavelengths is present, though with different\nintensities. This radiation is considered to be due to oscillations of atoms",

Hence, the\nradiation emitted can be considered due to individual atoms\nrather than because of interactions between atoms or\nmolecules.\nIn the early nineteenth century it was also established\nthat each element is associated with a characteristic\nspectrum of radiation, for example, hydrogen always gives\na set of lines with fixed relative position between the lines.\nThis fact suggested an intimate relationship between the\ninternal structure of an atom and the spectrum of\nradiation emitted by it. In 1885, Johann Jakob Balmer\n(1825 \u2013 1898) obtained a simple empirical formula which\ngave the wavelengths of a group of lines emitted by atomic\nhydrogen. Since hydrogen is simplest of the elements\nknown, we shall consider its spectrum in detail in this\nchapter.\nErnst Rutherford (1871\u20131937), a former research\nstudent of J. J. Thomson, was engaged in experiments on\n\u03b1-particles emitted by some radioactive elements.

This agreement supported\nthe hypothesis of the nuclear atom. This\nis why Rutherford is credited with the\ndiscovery of the nucleus.\nIn Rutherford\u2019s nuclear model of\nthe atom, the entire positive charge and\nmost of the mass of the atom are\nconcentrated in the nucleus with the\nelectrons some distance away. The\nelectrons would be moving in orbits\nabout the nucleus just as the planets\ndo around the sun. Rutherford\u2019s\nexperiments suggested the size of\nthe nucleus to be about 10 \u201315 m to\n10\u201314 m. From kinetic theory, the size\nof an atom was known to be 10 \u201310 m,\nabout 10,000 to 100,000 times larger\nthan the size of the nucleus. Thus, the electrons would seem to be at a\ndistance from the nucleus of about 10,000 to 100,000 times the size of\nthe nucleus itself. Thus, most of an atom is empty space. With the atom\nbeing largely empty space, it is easy to see why most \u03b1-particles go right\nthrough a thin metal foil. However , when \u03b1-particle happens to come\nnear a nucleus, the intense electric field there scatters it through a large\nangle.

As the gold foil is very thin, it\ncan be assumed that \u03b1-particles will suffer not more than one scattering\nduring their passage through it. Therefore, computation of the trajectory\nof an alpha-particle scattered by a single nucleus is enough. Alpha-\nparticles are nuclei of helium atoms and, therefore, carry two units, 2e,\nof positive charge and have the mass of the helium atom. The charge of\nthe gold nucleus is Ze, where Z is the atomic number of the atom; for\ngold Z = 79. Since the nucleus of gold is about 50 times heavier than an\n\u03b1-particle, it is reasonable to assume that it remains stationary\nthroughout the scattering process.

Thus, the a-particle\nreverses its motion without ever actually touching the gold nucleus.\n12.2.2  Electron orbits\nThe Rutherford nuclear model of the atom which involves classical\nconcepts, pictures the atom as an electrically neutral sphere consisting\nof a very small, massive and positively charged nucleus at the centre\nsurrounded by the revolving electrons in their respective dynamically\nstable orbits. The electrostatic force of attraction, Fe between the revolving\nelectrons and the nucleus provides the requisite centripetal force  (Fc)  to\nkeep them in their orbits.

These spectral lines are called emission lines.

In Thomson\u2019s model, an atom is a spherical cloud of positive charges\nwith electrons embedded in it.\n3. In Rutherford\u2019s model, most of the mass of the atom and all its positive\ncharge are concentrated in a tiny nucleus (typically one by ten thousand\nthe size of an atom), and the electrons revolve around it.\n4. Rutherford nuclear model has two main difficulties in explaining the\nstructure of atom: (a) It predicts that atoms are unstable because the\naccelerated electrons revolving around the nucleus must spiral into\nthe nucleus. This contradicts the stability of matter. (b) It cannot\nexplain the characteristic line spectra of atoms of different elements.\n5. Atoms of most of the elements are stable and emit characteristic\nspectrum. The spectrum consists of a set of isolated parallel lines\ntermed as line spectrum. It provides useful information about the\natomic structure.\n6. To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the stability\nof atoms, Niel\u2019s Bohr proposed a model for hydrogenic (single elctron)\natoms.

Before the discovery of\ntransistor in 1948, such devices were mostly vacuum tubes (also called\nvalves) like the vacuum diode which has two electrodes, viz., anode (often\ncalled plate) and cathode; triode which has three electrodes \u2013 cathode,\nplate and grid; tetrode and pentode (respectively with 4 and 5 electrodes).\nIn a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and\nthe controlled flow of these electrons in vacuum is obtained by varying\nthe voltage between its different electrodes. Vacuum is required in the\ninter-electrode space; otherwise the moving electr ons may lose their\nenergy on collision with the air molecules in their path. In these devices\nthe electrons can flow only from the cathode to the anode (i.e., only in one\ndirection). Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as valves.\nThese vacuum tube devices ar e bulky, consume high power , operate\ngenerally at high voltages (~100 V) and have limited life and low reliability.\nThe seed of the development of modern solid-state semiconductor\nelectronics goes back to 1930\u2019s when it was realised that some solid-\nstate semiconductors and their junctions offer the possibility of controlling\nthe number and the direction of flow of charge carriers through them.\nSimple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change",

But when\nthe atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other. So\nthe outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very\nclose or could even overlap. This would make the nature of electron motion\nin a solid very different from that in an isolated atom.\nInside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two\nelectrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges. Because\nof this, each electron will have a different energy level. These different\nenergy levels with continuous energy variation form what are called\nenergy bands.  The energy band which includes the energy levels of the\nvalence electrons is called the valence band. The energy band above the\nvalence band is called the conduction band.

Normally the conduction band is empty. But when\nit overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it. This is\nthe case with metallic conductors.\nIf there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence\nband, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons\nare available in the conduction band. This makes the material an\ninsulator. But some of the electr ons from the valence band may gain\nexternal energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the\nvalence band.

The total current, I is\nthus the sum of the electron current Ie and the\nhole current Ih:\nI = Ie + Ih (14.2)\nIt may be noted that apart from the process of generation of conduction\nelectrons and holes, a simultaneous process of recombination occurs in\nwhich the electrons recombine with the holes. At equilibrium, the rate of\ngeneration is equal to the rate of recombination of charge carriers. The\nrecombination occurs due to an electron colliding with a hole.\nFIGURE 14.4  Schematic two-dimensional\nrepresentation of Si or Ge structure showing\ncovalent bonds at low temperature\n(all bonds intact). +4 symbol",

Figure 14.11 shows the p-n junction at\nequilibrium and the potential across the junction. The\nn-material has lost electrons, and p material has acquired\nelectrons. The n material is thus positive relative to the p\nmaterial. Since this potential tends to prevent the movement of\nelectron from the n region into the p region, it is often called a\nbarrier potential .\nExample 14.3  Can we take one slab of p-type semiconductor and\nphysically join it to another n-type semiconductor to get p-n junction?\nSolution  No! Any slab, howsoever flat, will have roughness much\nlarger than the inter -atomic crystal spacing (~2 to 3 \u00c5) and hence\ncontinuous contact at the atomic level will not be possible. The junction\nwill behave as a discontinuity for the flowing charge carriers.",

So if an alternating voltage is\napplied across a diode the current flows only in that part of the cycle\nwhen the diode is forward biased. This property\nis used to rectify alternating voltages and the\ncircuit used for this purpose is called a rectifier.\nIf an alternating voltage is applied across a\ndiode in series with a load, a pulsating voltage will\nappear across the load only during the half cycles\nof the ac input during which the diode is forward\nbiased. Such rectifier circuit, as shown in\nFig. 14.18, is called a half-wave r ectifier. The\nsecondary of a transformer supplies the desired\nac voltage across terminals A and B. When the\nvoltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased\nand it conducts. When A is negative, the diode is\nreverse-biased and it does not conduct. The reverse\nsaturation current of a diode is negligible and can\nbe considered equal to zero for practical purposes.\n(The reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must\nbe sufficiently higher than the peak ac voltage at\nthe secondary of the transformer to protect the\ndiode from reverse breakdown.)\nTherefore, in the positive half-cycle of ac there\nis a current through the load resistor RL and we\nget an output voltage, as shown in Fig. 14.18(b),\nwhereas there is no current in the negative half-",

Since the\nrectified output of this circuit is only for half of the input ac wave it is\ncalled as half-wave rectifier.\nThe circuit using two diodes, shown in Fig. 14.19(a), gives output\nrectified voltage corresponding to both the positive as well as negative\nhalf of the ac cycle. Hence, it is known as full-wave rectifier. Here the\np-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the\ntransformer. The n-side of the diodes ar e connected together and the\noutput is taken between this common point of diodes and the midpoint\nof the secondary of the transfor mer.

Semiconductors are the basic materials used in the present solid state\nelectronic devices like diode, transistor, ICs, etc.\n2. Lattice structure and the atomic structure of constituent elements\ndecide whether a particular material will be insulator , metal or\nsemiconductor.\n3. Metals have low resistivity (10\u20132 to 10\u20138  Wm), insulators have very high\nresistivity (>108 W m\u20131), while semiconductors have intermediate values\nof resistivity.\n4. Semiconductors are elemental (Si, Ge) as well as compound (GaAs,\nCdS, etc.).\n5. Pure semiconductors are called \u2018intrinsic semiconductors\u2019. The presence\nof charge carriers (electrons and holes) is an \u2018intrinsic\u2019 property of the\nmaterial and these are obtained as a result of thermal excitation. The\nnumber of electrons (ne) is equal to the number of holes (\nnh ) in intrinsic\nconductors. Holes are essentially electron vacancies with an effective\npositive charge.\n6. The number of charge carriers can be changed by  \u2018doping\u2019 of a suitable\nimpurity in pure semiconductors. Such semiconductors are known as\nextrinsic semiconductors. These are of two types (n-type and p-type).\n7. In n-type semiconductors, ne >> nh while in p-type semiconductors nh >> ne.\n8. n-type semiconducting Si or Ge is obtained by doping with pentavalent\natoms (donors) like As, Sb, P, etc., while p-type Si or Ge can be obtained",

Further, the material possesses an overall charge\nneutrality.\n10. There are two distinct band of energies (called valence band and\nconduction band) in which the electr ons in a material lie.

All\nenergy levels in the valence band are filled while energy levels in the\nconduction band may be fully empty or partially filled. The electrons in\nthe conduction band are free to move in a solid and are responsible for\nthe conductivity. The extent of conductivity depends upon the energy\ngap (Eg) between the top of valence band ( EV ) and the bottom of the\nconduction band EC.

More\nimportant, if you decrease focal length, aberrations (both spherical\nand chromati c) become more pronounced. So, in practice, you\ncannot  get a magnifying power of more than 3 or so with a simple\nconvex lens. However, using an aberration corrected lens system,\none can increase this limit by a factor of 10 or so.\n(d) Angular magnification of eye-piece is [(25/fe ) + 1] ( fe in cm) which\nincr\neases if fe is smaller.

We see leaves falling fr om trees and water flowing\ndown a dam.  Automobiles and planes carry people from one\nplace to the other. The earth rotates once every twenty-four\nhours and revolves round the sun once in a year . The sun\nitself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving\nwithin its local group of galaxies.\nMotion is change in position of an object with time. How\ndoes the position change with time ? In this chapter, we shall\nlearn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the\nconcepts of velocity and acceleration. W e shall confine\nourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight\nline, also known as rectilinear motion . For the case of\nrectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple\nequations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative\nnature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.\nIn our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as\npoint objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size\nof the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a",

The magnitude\nof acceleration due to gravity is represented by\ng.  If air resistance is neglected, the object is\nsaid to be in free fall . If the height through\nwhich the object falls is small compared to the\nearth\u2019s radius, g can be taken to be constant,\nequal to   9.8 m s \u20132 . Free fall is thus a case of\nmotion with uniform acceleration.\nWe assume that the motion is in y-direction,\nmore corre ctly in \u2013 y-direction because we\nchoose upward direction as positive. Since the\nacceleration due to gravity is always downward,\nit is in the negative direction and we have\na = \u2013 g  = \u2013 9.8 m s\u20132\nThe object is released from rest at y = 0.

You should first specify\nthis choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity and acceleration.\n2. If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is\ndecreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity.  This\nstatement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.\n3. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle\u2019s speed is increasing or\ndecreasing.  The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice\nof the positive direction of the axis.  For example, if the vertically upward direction is\nchosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is\nnegative.  If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative,\nresults in increase in speed.  For a particle thrown upward, the same negative\nacceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed.\n4. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration\nat that instant.  A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero acceleration.\nFor example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost point but the\nacceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to gravity.",

Is the converse also true? Does an\nelectric field changing with time give rise to a magnetic field? James Clerk\nMaxwell (1831-1879), argued that this was indeed the case \u2013 not only\nan electric current but also a time-varying electric field generates magnetic\nfield. While applying the Ampere\u2019s circuital law to find magnetic field at a\npoint outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell\nnoticed an inconsistency in the Ampere\u2019s circuital law. He suggested the\nexistence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement\ncurrent to remove this inconsistency.\nMaxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic\nfields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. These\nequations are known as Maxwell\u2019s equations. Together with the Lorentz\nforce formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic laws\nof electromagnetism.\nThe most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell\u2019s equations\nis the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) time-\nvarying electric and magnetic fields that propagate in space.

B at the point P\nis non-zero no matter which surface is used for calculating it. B at a\npoint P outside the plates [Fig. 8.1(a)] is the same as at a point M just\ninside, as it should be. The current carried by conductors due to flow of\ncharges is called conduction current. The current, given by Eq. (8.4), is a\nnew term, and is due to changing electric field (or electric displacement,\nan old term still used sometimes). It is, therefore, called displacement\ncurrent or Maxwell\u2019s displacement current. Figure 8.2 shows the electric\nand magnetic fields inside the parallel plate capacitor discussed above.",

This band\nlies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visible\nspectrum. Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as heat waves. This\nis because water molecules present in most materials readily absorb\ninfrared waves (many other molecules, for example, CO2, NH3, also absorb\ninfrared waves). After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is,\nthey heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used in\nphysical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role in\nmaintaining the earth\u2019s warmth or average temperature through the\ngreenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easily\nthrough the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth\u2019s surface and re-\nradiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation is\ntrapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour.\nInfrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposes\nand to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for example\nsemiconductor light emitting diodes) also   emit infrared and are widely\nused in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TV\nsets, video recorders and hi-fi systems.\n8.4.4 Visible rays\nIt is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves.

An electric dipole is a basic source of\nelectromagnetic waves.\n3.

The basic difference between various types of electromagnetic waves\nlies in their wavelengths or frequencies since all of them travel through\nvacuum with the same speed. Consequently, the waves differ\nconsiderably in their mode of interaction with matter .\n2. Accelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. The\nwavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with the\ncharacteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus, gamma radiation,\nhaving wavelength of 10 \u201314  m to 10 \u201315  m, typically originate from an\natomic nucleus. X-rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio waves\nare produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmitting\nantenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength of\nabout the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atoms\nis, however, much longer in wavelength than atomic size.\n3. Infrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light,\nvibrate not only the electrons, but entire atoms or molecules of a\nsubstance. This vibration increases the internal energy and\nconsequently, the temperature of the substance. This is why infrared\nwaves are often called heat waves.\n4. The centre of sensitivity of our eyes coincides with the centre of the\nwavelength distribution of the sun. It is because humans have evolved\nwith visions most sensitive to the strongest wavelengths from\nthe sun.\nEXERCISES",

The result of a\nmeasurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a\nnumber (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit.\nAlthough the number of physical quantities appears to be\nvery large, we need only a limited number of units for\nexpressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter-\nrelated with one another. The units for the fundamental or\nbase quantities are called fundamental or base units. The\nunits of all other physical quantities can be expressed as\ncombinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the\nderived quantities are called derived units. A complete set\nof these units, both the base units and derived units, is\nknown as the system of units.\n1.2  THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS\nIn earlier time scientists of different countries were using\ndifferent systems of units for measurement. Three such\nsystems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS\nsystem were in use extensively till recently.\nThe base units for length, mass and time in these systems\nwere as follows :\n\u2022 In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second\nrespectively.\n\u2022 In FPS system they were foot, pound and second\nrespectively.\n\u2022 In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second\nrespectively.\nThe system of units which is at present internationally",

In this notation, every number is\nexpressed as a \u00d7 10 b, where a is a number\nbetween 1 and 10, and b is any positive or\nnegative exponent (or power) of 10.  In order to\nget an approximate idea of the number, we may\nround off the number a to 1 (for a \n\u2264 5) and to 10\n(for 5< a \u2264 10). Then the number can be\nexpressed approximately as 10 b in which the\nexponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of\nmagnitude of the physical quantity. When only\nan estimate is required, the quantity is of the\norder of 10b. For example, the diameter of the\nearth (1.28\u00d7107m) is of the order of 10 7m with\nthe order of magnitude 7. The diameter of\nhydrogen atom (1.06 \u00d710\u201310 m) is of the order of\n10\u201310 m, with the order of magnitude\n\u201310. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders\nof magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.\nIt is often customary to write the decimal after\nthe first digit.

Certain\nphysical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as\nlength, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance,\nand luminous intensity).\n2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly\nstandardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere,\nkelvin, mole and candela).  The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called\nfundamental or base units.\n3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a\ncombination of the base units and are called derived units.  A complete set of units,\nboth fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.\n4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present\ninternationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.\n5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and\nthe derived quantities obtained from them.  Certain derived units are expressed by\nmeans of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).\n6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m\nfor metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).\n7.

Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the\nspectrum (wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm) is called light. It is\nmainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret\nthe world around us.\nThere are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from\ncommon experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second,\nthat it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that\nthe speed of light is finite and measurable. Its presently accepted value\nin vacuum is c = 2.99792458 \u00d7 108 m s\u20131.  For many purposes, it suffices\nto take c = 3 \u00d7 10 8 m s\u20131 . The speed of light in vacuum is the highest\nspeed attainable in nature.\nThe intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to\ncontradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the\nspectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the\nwavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects\nthat we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger).\nIn this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be\nconsidered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining\nReprint 2025-26",

Also that\nthe incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to\nthe reflecting surface at the point of incidence lie\nin the same plane (Fig. 9.1).

The refractive index of the\nmaterial of the core is higher than that\nof the cladding.\nWhen a signal in the form of light is\ndirected at one end of the fibre at a suitable\nangle, it undergoes repeated total internal\nreflections along the length of the fibre and\nfinally comes out at the other end (Fig.\n9.14). Since light undergoes total internal\nreflection at each stage, there is no\nappreciable loss in the intensity of the light\nsignal. Optical fibres are fabricated such\nthat light reflected at one side of inner\nsurface strikes the other at an angle larger\nthan the critical angle. Even if the fibre is\nbent, light can easily travel along its length.\nThus, an optical fibre can be used to act as\nan optical pipe.\nA bundle of optical fibres can be put to",

The real image of an object placed between f and 2f from a convex lens\ncan be seen on a screen placed at the image location. If the screen is\nremoved, is the image still there?  This question puzzles many, because\nit is difficult to reconcile ourselves with an image suspended in air\nwithout a screen. But the image does exist. Rays from a given point\non the object are converging to an image point in space and diverging\naway. The screen simply diffuses these rays, some of which reach our\neye and we see the image. This can be seen by the images formed in\nair during a laser show.\n3. Image formation needs regular reflection/refraction. In principle, all\nrays from a given point should reach the same image point. This is\nwhy you do not see your image by an irregular reflecting object, say\nthe page of a book.\n4. Thick lenses give coloured images due to dispersion. The variety in\ncolour of objects we see around us is due to the constituent colours\nof the light incident on them. A monochromatic light may produce an\nentirely different perception about the colours on an object as seen in\nwhite light.\n5.

But in order to describe motion of an\nobject in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions\n(space), we need to use vectors to describe the above-\nmentioned physical quantities.  Therefore, it is first necessary\nto learn the language of vectors. What is a vecto r? How to\nadd, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of\nmultiplying a vector by a real number ? We shall learn this\nto enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and\nacceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object\nin a plane.  As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall\ndiscuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail\nthe projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of\nmotion that has a special significance in daily-life situations.\nWe shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail.\nThe equations developed in this chapter for motion in a\nplane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.\n3.2  SCALARS AND VECTORS\nIn physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or\nvectors.

Thus, a vector is\nrepresented by a bold face, e.g. by A, a, p, q, r, ...\nx, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light\nface A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y.\n3.2.1  Position and Displacement Vectors\nTo describe the position of an object moving in\na plane, we  need to choose a convenient point,\nsay O as origin. Let P and P\u2032 be the positions of\nthe object at time t and t\u2032, respectively [Fig. 3.1(a)].\nWe join O and P by a straight line.  Then, OP is\nthe position vector of the object at tim e t.  An\narrow is marked at the head of this line.  It is\nrepresented by a symbol r, i.e. OP = r.  Point P\u2032 is\nrepresented by another position vector , OP\u2032\ndenoted by r\u2032. The length of the vector r\nrepresents the magnitude of the vector and its\ndirection is the direction in which P lies as seen\nfrom O. If the object moves from P to P \u2032, the\nvector PP\u2032 (with tail at P and tip at P\u2032) is called\nthe displacement vector corresponding to\nmotion from point P (at time t) to point P\u2032 (at time t\u2032).\nFig. 3.1 (a) Position and displacement vectors.\n(b) Displacement vector PQ and different\n     courses of motion.\nIt is important to note that displacement\nvector is the straight line joining the initial and\nfinal positions and does not depend on the actual\npath undertaken by the object between the two\npositions.

For example, in Fig. 3.1(b), given the\ninitial and final positions as P and Q, the\ndisplacement vector is the same PQ for different\npaths of journey, say PABCQ, PDQ, and PBEFQ.\nTherefore, the magnitude of displacement is\neither less or equal to the path length of an\nobject between two points . This fact was\nemphasised in the previous chapter also while\ndiscussing motion along a straight line.\n3.2.2  Equality of Vectors\nTwo vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and\nonly if, they have the same magnitude and the\nsame direction.**\nFigure 3.2(a) shows two equal vectors A and\nB. We can easily check their equality.  Shift B\nparallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that\nof A, i.e. Q coincides with O. Then, since  their\ntips S and P also coincide, the two vectors are\nsaid to be equal.  In general, equality is indicated\n* Addition and subtraction of scalars make sense only for quantities with same units. However, you can multiply\nand divide scalars of different units.\n**In our study, vectors do not have fixed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector\nunchanged. Such vectors are called free vectors. However, in some physical applications, location or line of\napplication of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors.\nReprint 2025-26",

An object that is in flight after being\nthrown or projected is called a projectile.  Such\na projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a\nbaseball or any other object. The motion of a\nprojectile may be thought of as the result of two\nseparate, simultaneously occurring components\nof motions. One component is along a horizontal\ndirection without  any acceleration and the other\nalong the vertical direction with constant\nacceleration due to the force of gravity. It was\nGalileo who first stated this independency of the\nhorizontal and the vertical components of\nprojectile motion in his Dialogue on the great\nworld systems (1632).\nIn our discussion, we shall assume that the\nair resistance has negligible effect on the motion\nof the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is\nlaunched with velocity vo that makes an angle\n\u03b8o with  the x-axis as shown in Fig. 3.16.\nAfter the object has been projected, the\nacceleration acting on it is that due to gravity\nwhich is directed vertically downward:\na j= \u2212g \u0275\nOr, ax = 0, ay = \u2013 g       (3.35)",

A\nthorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was\nfirst published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist\nChristiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was\nprobably known to Newton also some years earlier.\n\u201cCentripetal\u201d comes from a Greek term which means\n\u2018centre-seeking\u2019.  Since v and R are constant, the\nmagnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also\nconstant. However , the dir ection changes \u2014\npointing always towards the centre.  Therefore, a\ncentripetal acceleration is not a constant vector.\nWe have another way of describing the\nvelocity and the acceleration of an object  in\nuniform circular motion.

The displacement depends only on the end points; the\npath length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are\nequal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all\nother cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement.\n2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the\npath length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.\n3. The vector equations (3.33a) and (3.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course,\nyou can always resolve them along any two independent axes.\n4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform\ncircular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its\ndirection is changing.\n5. An object subjected to two velocities v1 and v2 has a resultant velocity v = v1 + v2. Take\ncare to distinguish it from velocity of object 1 relative to velocity of object 2 : v12= v1 \u2212 v2.\nHere v1 and v2 are velocities with reference to some common reference frame.\n6.

Towards the same period at the end\nof 19th century, experimental investigations on conduction of electricity\n(electric discharge) through gases at low pressure in a discharge tube led\nto many historic discoveries. The discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895,\nand of electron by J. J. Thomson in 1897, were important milestones in\nthe understanding of atomic structure. It was found that at sufficiently\nlow pressure of about 0.001 mm of mercury column, a discharge took\nplace between the two electrodes on applying the electric field to the gas\nin the discharge tube. A fluorescent glow appeared on the glass opposite\nto cathode. The colour of glow of the glass depended on the type of glass,\nit  being  yellowish-green for soda glass. The cause of this fluorescence\nwas attributed to the radiation which appeared to be coming from the\ncathode. These cathode rays  were discovered, in 1870, by William\nCrookes who later, in 1879, suggested that these rays consisted of streams\nof fast moving negatively charged particles.

They were found to travel with speeds ranging from about 0.1\nto 0.2 times the speed of light (3 \u00d7108 m/s). The presently accepted value\nof e/m is 1.76 \u00d7 1011 C/kg. Further, the value of e/m was found to be\nindependent of the nature of the material/metal used as the cathode\n(emitter), or the gas introduced in the discharge tube. This observation\nsuggested the universality of the cathode ray particles.\nAround the same time, in 1887, it was found that certain metals, when\nirradiated by ultraviolet light, emitted negatively charged particles having\nsmall speeds. Also, certain metals when heated to a high temperature were\nfound to emit negatively charged particles. The value of e/m of these particles\nwas found to be the same as that for cathode ray particles. These\nobservations thus established that all these particles, although produced\nunder different conditions, were identical in nature. J. J. Thomson, in 1897,\nnamed these particles as electrons , and suggested that they were\nfundamental, universal  constituents of matter.

Millikan\u2019s experiment established that electric\ncharge is quantised. From the values of charge ( e) and specific charge\n(e/m), the mass (m) of the electron could be determined.\n11.2  ELECTRON EMISSION\nWe know that metals have free electrons (negatively charged particles) that\nare responsible for their conductivity. However, the free electrons cannot\nnormally escape out of the metal surface. If an electron attempts to come\nout of the metal, the metal surface acquires a positive charge  and pulls the\nelectron back to  the metal. The free electron is thus held inside the metal\nsurface by the attractive forces of the ions. Consequently, the electron can\ncome out of the metal surface only if it has got sufficient energy to overcome\nthe attractive pull. A certain minimum amount of energy is required to be\ngiven  to an electron to pull it out from the surface of the metal. This\nminimum energy required by an electron to escape from the metal surface\nis called the work function of the metal. It is generally denoted by \nf0 and\nmeasured in eV (electron volt). One electron volt is the energy gained by an",

When light falls\non a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy\nfrom the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions\nin the material of the surface. After gaining sufficient energy from the\nincident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the\nsurrounding space.\n11.3.2  Hallwachs\u2019 and Lenard\u2019s observations\nWilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of\nphotoelectric emission in detail during 1886-1902.",

In this picture,\nphotoelectric emission does not take place by continuous absorption of\nenergy from radiation. Radiation energy is built up of discrete units\u2013 the\nso called quanta of energy of radiation.

If this quantum of energy absorbed exceeds the minimum\nenergy needed for the electron to escape from the metal surface (work\nfunction f0), the electron is emitted with maximum kinetic energy\nKmax = hn \u2013 f0 (11.2)\nMore tightly bound electrons will emerge with kinetic energies less\nthan the maximum value.

He measured the slope of the straight\nline obtained for sodium, similar to that shown in Fig. 11.5. Using the\nknown value of e, he determined the value of Planck\u2019s constant h.

De Br oglie proposed that the wave\nlength \nl  associated with a particle of momentum p  is\ngiven as\nl  = h h\np m v= (11.5)\nwhere m  is the mass of the particle and v its speed.\nEquation (11.5) is known as the \nde Broglie relation and",

(A particle is ideally represented as a\npoint mass having no size.)  W e applied the r esults of our\nstudy even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming\nthat motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the\nmotion of a particle.\nAny r eal body which we encounter in daily life has a\nfinite size.  In dealing with the motion of extended bodies\n(bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is\ninadequate.  In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this\ninadequacy.  We shall attempt to build an understanding of\nthe motion of extended bodies.  An extended body, in the\nfirst place, is a system of particles.  We shall begin with the\nconsideration of motion of the system as a whole.  The centre\nof mass of a system of particles will be a key concept her e.\nWe shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system\nof particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding\nthe motion of extended bodies.\nA large class of pr oblems with extended bodies can be\nsolved by considering them to be rigid bodies.  Ideally a\nrigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and\nunchanging shape.  The distances between all pairs of\nparticles of such a body do not change. It is evident from\nthis definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid,",

Ideally, a rigid body is one for which the distances between different particles of the\nbody do not change, even though there are forces on them.\n2. A rigid body fixed at one point or along a line can have only rotational motion. A rigid\nbody not fixed in some way can have either pure translational motion or a combination\nof translational and rotational motions.\n3. In rotation about a fixed axis, every particle of the rigid body moves in a circle which\nlies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Every Point in\nthe rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity at any instant of time.\n4. In pure translation, every particle of the body moves with the same velocity at any\ninstant of time.\n5. Angular velocity is a vector. Its magnitude is \n\u03c9 = d\u03b8/dt and it is directed along the axis\nof rotation. For rotation about a fixed axis, this vector \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 has a fixed direction.\n6. The vector or cross product of two vector a and b is a vector written as a\u00d7b. The\nmagnitude of this vector is absin\u03b8  and its direction is given by the right handed screw\nor the right hand rule.\n7. The linear velocity of a particle of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by\nv = \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u00d7 r, where r is the position vector of the particle with respect to an origin along the\nfixed axis.

It explained the laws of reflection and refraction of light at an interface.\nThe corpuscular model predicted that if the ray of light (on refraction)\nbends towards the normal then the speed of light would be greater in the\nsecond medium. This corpuscular model of light was further developed\nby Isaac Newton in his famous book entitled OPTICKS and because of\nthe tremendous popularity of this book, the corpuscular model is very\noften attributed to Newton.\nIn 1678, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens put forward the\nwave theory of light \u2013 it is this wave model of light that we will discuss in\nthis chapter. As we will see, the wave model could satisfactorily explain\nthe phenomena of reflection and refraction; however, it predicted that on\nrefraction if the wave bends towards the normal then the speed of light\nwould be less in the second medium. This is in contradiction to the\nprediction made by using the corpuscular model of light. It was much\nlater confirmed by experiments where it was shown that the speed of\nlight in water is less than the speed in air confirming the prediction of the\nwave model; Foucault carried out this experiment in 1850.\nThe wave theory was not readily accepted primarily because of\nNewton\u2019s authority and also because light could travel through vacuum\nReprint 2025-26",

However, when Thomas Young performed\nhis famous interference experiment in 1801, it was firmly established\nthat light is indeed a wave phenomenon. The wavelength of visible\nlight was measured and found to be extremely small; for example, the\nwavelength of yellow light is about 0. 6 mm. Because of the smallness\nof the wavelength of visible light (in comparison to the dimensions of\ntypical mirrors and lenses), light can be assumed to approximately\ntravel in straight lines. This is the field of geometrical optics, which we\nhad discussed in the previous chapter. Indeed, the branch of optics in\nwhich one completely neglects the finiteness of the wavelength is called\ngeometrical optics and a ray is defined as the path of energy\npropagation in the limit of wavelength tending to zero.\nAfter the interference experiment of Young in 1801, for the next 40\nyears or so, many experiments were carried out involving the\ninterference and diffraction of lightwaves; these experiments could only\nbe satisfactorily explained by assuming a wave model of light. Thus,\naround the middle of the nineteenth century, the wave theory seemed\nto be very well established.

This was explained\nwhen Maxwell put forward his famous electromagnetic theory of light.\nMaxwell had developed a set of equations describing the laws of\nelectricity and magnetism and using these equations he derived what\nis known as the wave equation from which he predicted  the existence\nof electromagnetic waves *. From the wave equation, Maxwell could\ncalculate the speed of electromagnetic waves in free space and he found\nthat the theoretical value was very close to the measured value of speed\nof light. From this, he propounded that light must be an\nelectromagnetic wave . Thus, according to Maxwell, light waves are\nassociated with changing electric and magnetic fields; changing electric\nfield produces a time and space varying magnetic field and a changing\nmagnetic field produces a time and space varying electric field. The\nchanging electric and magnetic fields result in the propagation of\nelectromagnetic waves (or light  waves) even in vacuum.\nIn this chapter we will first discuss the original formulation of the\nHuygens principle  and derive the laws of reflection and refraction.

Every\npoint on the surface starts oscillating with time. At any instant, a\nphotograph of the surface would show circular rings on which the\ndisturbance is maximum. Clearly, all points on such a circle are\noscillating in phase because they are at the same distance from the\nsource. Such a locus of points, which oscillate in phase is called a\nwavefront ; thus a wavefront is defined as a surface of constant\nphase. The speed with which the wavefront moves outwards from the\nsource is called the speed of the wave. The energy of the wave travels\nin a direction perpendicular to the wavefront.\nIf we have a point source emitting waves uniformly in all directions,\nthen the locus of points which have the same amplitude and vibrate in\nthe same phase are spheres and we have what is known as a spherical\nwave as shown in Fig. 10.1(a). At a large distance from the source, a\nsmall portion of the sphere can be considered as a plane and we have\nwhat is known as a plane wave [Fig. 10.1(b)].\nNow, if we know the shape of the wavefront at t = 0, then Huygens\nprinciple allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later\ntime \nt.

If\nwe use two sodium lamps illuminating two pinholes\n(Fig. 10.11) we will not observe any interference fringes.\nThis is because of the fact that the light wave emitted\nfrom an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) undergoes\nabrupt phase changes in times of the order of 10 \u201310\nseconds. Thus the light waves coming out from two\nindependent sources of light will not have any fixed\nphase relationship and would be incoherent, when this\nhappens, as discussed in the previous section, the\nintensities on the screen will add up.\nThe British physicist Thomas Y oung used an\ningenious technique to \u201clock\u201d the phases of the waves\nemanating from S1 and S2. He made two pinholes S 1\nand S2 (very close to each other) on an opaque screen [Fig. 10.12(a)].\nThese were illuminated by another pinholes that was in turn, lit by a\nbright source. Light waves spread out from S and fall on both S1 and S2.\nS1 and S2 then behave like two coherent sources because light waves\ncoming out from S 1 and S2 are derived from the same original source\nand any abrupt phase change in S will manifest in exactly similar phase",

Huygens\u2019 construction tells us that the new wavefront is the forward\nenvelope of the secondary waves. When the speed of light is\nindependent of direction, the secondary waves are spherical. The rays\nare then perpendicular to both the wavefronts and the time of travel\nis the same measured along any ray. This principle leads to the well\nknown laws of reflection and refraction.\n3.

Boyle,\nNewton and several others tried to explain the behaviour of\ngases by considering that gases are made up of tiny atomic\nparticles. The actual atomic theory got established more than\n150 years later. Kinetic theory explains the behaviour of gases\nbased on the idea that the gas  consists of rapidly moving\natoms or molecules. This is possible as the inter-atomic forces,\nwhich are short range for ces that ar e important for solids\nand liquids,  can be neglected for gases. The kinetic theory\nwas developed in the nineteenth century by Maxwell,\nBoltzmann and others. It has been remarkably successful. It\ngives a molecular interpretation of  pressure and temperature\nof a gas, and is consistent with gas laws and A vogadro\u2019s\nhypothesis. It corr ectly explains specific heat capacities of\nmany gases. It also r elates measurable pr operties of gases\nsuch as viscosity, conduction and dif fusion with molecular\nparameters, yielding estimates of molecular sizes and masses.\nThis chapter gives an introduction to kinetic theory.\n12.2 MOLECULAR NATURE OF MATTER\nRichard Feynman, one of the great physicists of 20th century\nconsiders the discovery that \u201cMatter is made up of atoms\u201d to\nbe a very significant one.

In the Vaiseshika\nschool of thought in India founded by Kanada (Sixth century B.C.) the atomic picture was developed in\nconsiderable detail. Atoms were thought to be eternal, indivisible, infinitesimal and ultimate parts of matter.\nIt was argued that if matter could be subdivided without an end, there would be no difference between a\nmustard seed and the Meru mountain.  The four kinds of atoms ( Paramanu \u2014 Sanskrit word for the\nsmallest particle) postulated were Bhoomi (Earth), Ap (water), Tejas (fire) and Vayu (air) that have characteristic\nmass and other attributes, were propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structure and\nwas continuous and inert. Atoms combine to form different molecules (e.g. two atoms combine to form a\ndiatomic molecule dvyanuka, three atoms form a tryanuka or a triatomic molecule), their properties depending\nupon the nature and ratio of the constituent atoms.  The size of the atoms was also estimated, by conjecture\nor by methods that are not known to us.  The estimates vary. In Lalitavistara, a famous biography of the\nBuddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the modern estimate of atomic\nsize, of the order of 10\u201310 m.",

So the\nvolume of the vapour is  1000/0.6  = 1/(6 \u00d7 10 -4 )\ntimes larger.  If densities of bulk water and water\nmolecules are same, then the fraction of\nmolecular volume to the total volume in liquid\nstate is 1.

The\ndensity of water molecule may therefore, be\nregarded as roughly equal to the density of bulk\nwater = 1000 kg m\u20133.

While each translational and\nrotational degree of freedom has contributed only\none \u2018squared term\u2019 in Eq.(12.26), one vibrational\nmode contributes two \u2018squared terms\u2019 : kinetic\nand potential energies.\nEach quadratic term occurring in the\nexpression for energy is a mode of absorption of\nenergy by the molecule. W e have seen that in\nthermal equilibrium at absolute temperature T,\nfor each translational mode of motion, the\naverage energy is \u00bd kBT. The most elegant\nprinciple of classical statistical mechanics (first\nproved by Maxwell) states that this is so for each\nmode of energy: translational, rotational and\nvibrational. That is, in equilibrium, the total\nenergy is equally distributed in all possible\nenergy modes, with each mode having an average\nenergy equal to  \u00bd kBT. This is known as the law\nof equipartition of energy. Accordingly, each\ntranslational and rotational degree of freedom\nof a molecule contributes \u00bd kBT  to the energy,\nwhile each vibrational frequency contributes\n2 \u00d7 \u00bd kBT  = kBT ,  since a vibrational mode has\nboth kinetic and potential energy modes.\nThe proof of the law of equipartition of energy\nis beyond the scope of this book.

Pressure exists everywhere in a fluid.\nAny layer of gas inside the volume of a container is in equilibrium because the pressure\nis the same on both sides of the layer.\n2. We should not have an exaggerated idea of the intermolecular distance in a gas. At\nordinary pressures and temperatures, this is only 10 times or so the interatomic distance\nin solids and liquids. What is different is the mean free path which in a gas is 100 times\nthe interatomic distance and 1000 times the size of the molecule.\n3. The law of equipartition of energy is stated thus: the energy for each degree of freedom\nin thermal equilibrium is \u00bd k\nB\n T. Each quadratic term in the total energy expression of\na molecule is to be counted as a degree of freedom. Thus, each vibrational mode gives 2\n(not 1) degrees of freedom (kinetic and potential energy modes), corresponding to the\nenergy 2 \u00d7 \u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7 \u00bd k\nB\n T = k\nB\n T.\n4.

They\nfound that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. For example,\nan electric current deflects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity.\nThis naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible?\nCan moving magnets produce electric currents? Does the nature permit\nsuch a relation between electricity and magnetism? The answer is\nresounding yes! The experiments of Michael Faraday in England and\nJoseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1830, demonstrated\nconclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils when\nsubjected to changing magnetic fields. In this chapter, we will study the\nphenomena associated with changing magnetic fields and understand\nthe underlying principles. The phenomenon in which electric current is\ngenerated by varying magnetic fields is appropriately called\nelectromagnetic induction .\nWhen Faraday first made public his discovery that relative motion\nbetween a bar magnet and a wire loop produced a small current in the\nlatter, he was asked, \u201cWhat is the use of it?\u201d His reply was: \u201cWhat is the\nuse of a new born baby?\u201d The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction\nChapter Six\nELECTROMAGNETIC\nINDUCTION\nReprint 2025-26",

A\nplausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is\nas follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in\ncoil C2 (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a\nmaximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic\nflux through the neighbouring coil C1 also increases. It is the change in\nmagnetic flux through coil C1 that produces an induced emf in coil C1.\nWhen the key is held pressed, current in coil C2 is constant. Therefore,\nthere is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C1 and the current in\ncoil C1 drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C2 and the\nresulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a\nshort time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C 1\nand hence again induces an electric current in coil C 1*. The common\npoint in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic\nflux through a circuit induces emf in it.

The statement of the law is:\nThe polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current\nwhich opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.\nThe negative sign shown in Eq.

In\nFig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed\ntowards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards\nthe coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is\ninduced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.\nThis is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise\ndirection with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.\nNote that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity\ntowards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-\npole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux\nthrough the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,\nthe induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-\npole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in\nan attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the",

It is also possible that emf is induced in a\nsingle isolated coil due to change of flux through the coil by means of\nvarying the current through the same coil.

The magnetic flux through a surface of area A placed in a uniform magnetic\nfield B is defined as,\nFB = B.A = BA cos q\nwhere q is the angle between B and A.\n2.

If the circuit is\nclosed, a current I = e/R is set up in it, where R is the resistance of the\ncircuit.\n3. Lenz\u2019s law states that the polarity of the induced emf is such that it\ntends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux\nthat produces it. The negative sign in the expression for Faraday\u2019s law\nindicates this fact.\n4. When a metal rod of length l is placed normal to a uniform magnetic\nfield B and moved with a velocity v perpendicular to the field, the\ninduced emf (called motional emf) across its ends is\ne = Bl v\n5.

In the early part of the\nnineteenth century, the experiments of Oersted, Ampere and others\nestablished that moving charges (currents) produce a magnetic field.\nSomewhat later, around 1830, the experiments of Faraday and Henry\ndemonstrated that a moving magnet can induce electric current.\n2. In a closed circuit, electric currents are induced so as to oppose the\nchanging magnetic flux. It is as per the law of conservation of energy.\nHowever, in case of an open cir cuit, an emf is induced acr oss its ends.\nHow is it related to the flux change?\n3. The motional emf discussed in Section 6.5 can be argued independently\nfrom Faraday\u2019s law using the Lorentz force on moving charges. However,\neven if the charges are stationary [and the q (v \u00d7 B) term of the Lorentz\nforce is not operative], an emf is nevertheless induced in the presence of a\ntime-varying magnetic field. Thus, moving charges in static field and static\ncharges in a time-varying field seem to be symmetric situation for Faraday\u2019s\nlaw. This gives a tantalising hint on the relevance of the principle of\nrelativity for Faraday\u2019s law.\nEXERCISES\n6.1 Predict the direction of induced current in the situations described\nby the following Figs. 6.15(a) to (f ).\nQuantity Symbol Units Dimensions Equations\nMagnetic Flux FB Wb (weber) [M L2 T\u20132 A\u20131 ] FB = B Ai\nEMF e V (volt) [M L2 T\u20133 A\u20131 ] e = Bd( )/dN t\u03a6\u2212",

For example, a gas inside a closed\nrigid container, completely insulated fr om its\nsurroundings, with fixed values of pressure,\nvolume, temperature, mass and composition that\ndo not change with time, is in a state of\nthermodynamic equilibrium.\nFig. 11.1 (a) Systems A and B (two gases) separated\nby an adiabatic wall \u2013 an insulating wall\nthat does not allow flow of heat.

Temperature is a marker\nof the \u2018hotness\u2019 of a body. It determines the\ndirection of flow of heat when two bodies are\nplaced in thermal contact.  Heat flows from the\nbody at a higher temperature to the one at lower\ntemperature. The flow stops when the\ntemperatures equalise; the two bodies are then\nin thermal equilibrium.

We know that every\nbulk system consists of a large number of\nmolecules.  Internal energy is simply the sum of\nthe kinetic energies and potential energies of\nthese molecules. W e remarked earlier that in\nthermodynamics, the kinetic energy of the\nsystem, as a whole, is not relevant.  Internal\nenergy is thus, the sum of molecular kinetic and\npotential energies in the frame of reference\nrelative to which the centre of mass of the system\nis at rest.

Experience shows\nthere are two ways of changing the state of the\ngas (and hence its internal energy).  One way is\nto put the cylinder in contact with a body at a\nhigher temperature than that of the gas. The\ntemperature difference will cause a flow of\nenergy (heat) from the hotter body to the gas,\nthus increasing the internal energy of the gas.\nThe other way is to push the piston down i.e. to\ndo work on the system, which again results in\nincreasing the internal energy of the gas.

Common\nexperience shows that there are many\nconceivable processes that are perfectly\nallowed by the First Law and yet are never\nobserved.  For example, nobody has ever seen\na book lying on a table jumping to a height by\nitself.  But such a thing would be possible if\nthe principle of conservation of energy were\nthe only restriction. The table could cool\nspontaneously, converting some of its internal\nenergy into an equal amount of mechanical\nenergy of the book, which would then hop to a\nheight with potential energy equal to the\nmechanical energy it acquired.  But this never\nhappens. Clearly, some additional basic\nprinciple of nature forbids the above, even\nthough it satisfies the energy conservation\nprinciple.  This principle, which  disallows\nmany phenomena consistent with the First\nLaw of Thermodynamics is known as the\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics.\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics gives\na fundamental limitation to the efficiency of a\nheat engine and the co-efficient of\nperformance of a refrigerator. In simple terms,\nit says that efficiency of a heat engine can\nnever be unity. For a r efrigerator , the Second\nLaw says that the co-efficient of performance\ncan never be infinite.

Interestingly, Carnot arrived at the\ncorrect answer, even though the basic concepts\nof heat and thermodynamics had yet to be firmly\nestablished.\nWe expect the ideal engine operating between\ntwo temperatures to be a reversible engine.\nIrreversibility is associated with dissipative\neffects, as remarked in the preceding section,\nand lowers efficiency. A process is reversible if\nit is quasi-static and non-dissipative.

This implies that\nin a reversible heat engine operating between\ntwo temperatures, heat should be absorbed\n(from the hot reservoir) isothermally and\nreleased (to the cold reservoir) isothermally.

But voltages\nand currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains\nsupply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function\nwith time. Such a voltage is called alter nating voltage (ac voltage) and\nthe current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac\ncurrent)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.\nThis is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power\ncompanies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main\nreason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages\ncan be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by\nmeans of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted\neconomically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which\nare exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we\ntune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a special\nproperty of ac circuits \u2013 one of many that you will study in this chapter.\nChapter Seven\nALTERNATING\nCURRENT\n* The phrases ac voltage  and ac current  are contradictory and redundant,\nrespectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage and alternating\ncurrent current .

But this is not so in the case  of an inductor,\na capacitor or a combination  of these circuit elements. In order to show\nphase relationship between voltage and current\nin an ac circuit, we use the notion of phasors.\nThe analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the\nuse of a phasor diagram. A phasor* is a vector\nwhich rotates about the origin with angular\nspeed w, as shown in Fig. 7.4. The vertical\ncomponents of phasors V and I represent the\nsinusoidally varying quantities v and i. The\nmagnitudes of phasors V and I represent  the\namplitudes or the peak values vm and im of these\noscillating quantities. Figure 7.4(a) shows the\nvoltage and current phasors and their\nrelationship at time t1 for the case of an ac source\nconnected to a resistor i.e., corresponding to the\ncircuit shown in Fig. 7.1. The projection of\nvoltage and current phasors on vertical axis, i.e., vm sin\nw t and im sinw t,\nrespectively represent the value of voltage and current at that instant. As\nthey rotate with frequency w, curves in Fig. 7.4(b) are generated.\nFrom Fig. 7.4(a) we see that phasors V and I for the case of a resistor are\nin the same direction. This is so for all times. This means that the phase\nangle between the voltage and the current is zero.\n7.4  AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO AN INDUCTOR",

This is done with\na device called transformer using the principle of mutual induction.\nA transformer consists of two sets of coils, insulated from each other.\nThey are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as in\nFig. 7.16(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.16(b). One of the\ncoils called the primary coil has Np turns. The other coil is called the\nsecondary coil; it has Ns turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil\nand the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer.\nFIGURE 7.16 Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:\n(a) two coils on top of each other , (b) two coils on separate limbs of the cor e.\nWhen an alternating voltage is applied to the  primary, the resulting\ncurrent produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary\nand induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number of\nturns in the secondary. We consider an ideal transformer in which the\nprimary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both\nprimary and secondary windings.

Vast, distant galaxies, the\ntiny invisible atoms, humans and beasts all are permeated through and\nthrough with a host of magnetic fields from a variety of sources. The earth\u2019s\nmagnetism predates human evolution. The word magnet is derived from\nthe name of an island in Greece called magnesia  where magnetic ore\ndeposits were found, as early as 600 BC.\nIn the previous chapter we have learned that moving charges or electric\ncurrents produce magnetic fields. This discovery, which was made in the\nearly part of the nineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot\nand Savart, among others.\nIn the present chapter, we take a look at magnetism as a subject in its\nown right.\nSome of the commonly known ideas regarding magnetism are:\n(i) The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic field pointing\napproximately from the geographic south to the north.\n(ii) When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in  the north-south\ndirection. The tip which points to the geographic north is called the\nnorth pole and the tip which points to the geographic south is called\nthe south pole of the magnet.\nChapter Five\nMAGNETISM AND\nMATTER\nReprint 2025-26",

Cutting a bar magnet in\nhalf is like cutting a solenoid. We get two smaller solenoids with weaker\nmagnetic properties. The field lines remain continuous, emerging from\none face of the solenoid and entering into the other face. One can test this\nanalogy by moving a small compass needle in the neighbourhood of a\nbar magnet and a current-carrying finite solenoid and noting that the\ndeflections of the needle are similar in both cases.\nTo make this analogy more firm we may calculate the axial field of a\nfinite solenoid depicted in Fig. 5.3 (a). We can demonstrate that at large\ndistances this axial field resembles that of a bar magnet.\nThe magnitude of the field at point P due to the solenoid is\n0\n3\n2\n4\nmB r\n\u00b5\n\u03c0= (5.1)\nThis is also the far axial magnetic field of a bar magnet which one may\nobtain experimentally.

The field lines\nshown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively charged\nwire. The correct magnetic field lines are circling the straight\nconductor, as described in Chapter 4.\n(b) Wrong. Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never cross\neach other, because otherwise the direction of field at the point of\nintersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure.\nMagnetostatic field lines can never form closed loops around empty\nspace.

By contrast, electrostatic\nfield lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space,\nnor when the loop encloses charges.\n(c) Right.

When magnetic\nfield is applied, those electrons having orbital magnetic moment in the\nsame direction slow down and those in the opposite direction speed up.\nThis happens due to induced current in accordance with Lenz\u2019s law which\nyou will study in Chapter 6.

They have strong tendency to move\nfrom a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get\nstrongly attracted to a magnet.\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material\npossess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material. However, they\ninteract with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align\nthemselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called\ndomain. The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum\nmechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. Each domain has a\nnet magnetisation. Typical domain size is 1mm and the domain contains\nabout 1011 atoms. In the first instant, the magnetisation varies randomly\nfrom domain to domain and there is no bulk magnetisation. This is shown\nin Fig. 5.8(a). When we apply an external magnetic field B0, the domains\norient themselves in the direction of B0 and simultaneously the domain\noriented in the direction of B0 grow in size. This existence of domains and\ntheir motion in B0 are not speculations. One may observe this under a\nmicroscope after sprinkling a liquid suspension of powdered\nferromagnetic substance of samples. This motion of suspension can be\nobserved. Fig. 5.8(b) shows the situation when the domains have aligned\nand amalgamated to form a single \u2018giant\u2019 domain.",

In some ferromagnetic materials the\nmagnetisation persists. Such materials are called hard magnetic materials\nor hard ferromagnets\n. Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobalt\nand copper, is one such material. The naturally occurring lodestone is\nanother. Such materials form permanent magnets to be used among other\nthings as a compass needle.

But technological\nexploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientific\nunderstanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding is\nnot a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science\nand engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other in\ntandem.\n2. Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get\ntwo smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative\ncharges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the\nelectronic charge with value | e| = 1.6 \u00d710\u201319 C. All other charges are\nintegral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is\nquantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why\nelectric charge is quantised.\n3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that\nthe magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast,\nthe electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate\non the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).\n4. A miniscule difference in the value of \n\u03c7, the magnetic susceptibility, yields\nradically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic.

Both these motions are\nnon-repetitive. We have also lear nt about unifor m circular\nmotion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system. In\nthese cases, the motion is repeated after a certain interval of\ntime, that is, it is periodic. In your childhood, you must have\nenjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing. Both\nthese motions are repetitive in nature but different from the\nperiodic motion of a planet. Here, the object moves to and fro\nabout a mean position. The pendulum of a wall clock executes\na similar motion. Examples of such periodic to and fro\nmotion abound: a boat tossing up and down in a river , the\npiston in a steam engine going back and forth, etc. Such a\nmotion is termed as oscillatory motion. In this chapter we\nstudy this motion.\nThe study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its\nconcepts are required for the understanding of many physical\nphenomena. In musical instruments, like the sitar, the guitar\nor the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce\npleasing sounds. The membranes in drums and diaphragms\nin telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about\ntheir mean positions. The vibrations of air molecules make\nthe propagation of sound possible.

Suppose\nan insect climbs up a ramp and falls down, it\ncomes back to the initial point and repeats the\nprocess identically. If you draw a graph of its\nheight above the ground versus time, it would\nlook something like Fig. 13.1 (a). If a child climbs\nup a step, comes down, and repeats the process\nidentically, its height above the ground would\nlook like that in Fig. 13.1 (b). When you play the\ngame of bouncing a ball off the ground, between\nyour palm and the ground, its height versus time\ngraph would look like the one in Fig. 13.1 (c).\nNote that both the curved parts in Fig. 13.1 (c)\nare sections of a parabola given by the Newton\u2019s\nequation of motion (see section 2.6),\n21\n2 + gth = ut  for downward motion, and\n21\n2 \u2013 gth = ut  for upward motion,\nwith different values of u in each case. These\nare examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion\nthat repeats itself at regular intervals of time is\ncalled periodic motion.\nFig. 13.1 Examples of periodic motion. The period T\nis shown in each case.\nVery often, the body under going periodic\nmotion has an equilibrium position somewhere\ninside its path. When the body is at this position\nno net external force acts on it. Therefore, if it is\nleft there at rest, it remains there forever. If the\nbody is given a small displacement from the\nposition, a force comes into play which tries to\nbring the body back to the equilibrium point,",

Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but\nevery periodic motion need not be oscillatory.\nCircular motion is a periodic motion, but it is\nnot oscillatory.\nThere is no significant difference between\noscillations and vibrations. It seems that when\nthe frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like,\nthe oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when\nthe frequency is high, we call it vibration (like,\nthe vibration of a string of a musical instrument).\nSimple harmonic motion is the simplest form\nof oscillatory motion. This motion arises when\nthe force on the oscillating body is directly\nproportional to its displacement from the mean\nposition, which is also the equilibrium position.\nFurther, at any point in its oscillation, this force\nis directed towards the mean position.\nIn practice, oscillating bodies eventually\ncome to rest at their equilibrium positions\nbecause of the damping due to friction and other\ndissipative causes.

The radial\nacceleration is provided by the net radial force\nT \u2013mg cos\u03b8, while the tangential acceleration is\nprovided by mg sin\u03b8. It is more convenient to\nwork with torque about the support since the\nradial force gives zero torque.

Every periodic motion is not simple harmonic motion. Only that periodic motion\ngoverned by the force law F = \u2013 k x is simple harmonic.\n3. Circular motion can arise due to an inverse-square law force (as in planetary motion)\nas well as due to simple har monic force in two dimensions equal to: \u2013 m\n\u03c92r.  In the\nlatter case, the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (x and y) must differ\nby \u03c0/2. Thus, for example, a particle subject to a force  \u2013 m\u03c92r with initial position (0,\nA) and velocity ( \u03c9A, 0) will move uniformly in a circle of radius A.\n4. For linear simple harmonic motion with a given \u03c9, two initial conditions are necessary\nand sufficient to determine the motion completely.  The  initial  conditions may be (i)\ninitial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy\nand phase.\n5. From point 4 above, given  amplitude or energy, phase of motion is determined by the\ninitial position or initial velocity.\n6. A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases\nis not necessarily periodic.  It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral\nmultiple of the other\u2019s frequency.  However, a periodic motion can always be expressed\nas a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes.",

What happens in a system, which is\na collection of such objects? A material medium provides\nsuch an example. Here, elastic forces bind the constituents\nto each other and, therefore, the motion of one affects that of\nthe other. If you drop a little pebble in a pond of still water,\nthe water surface gets disturbed. The disturbance does not\nremain confined to one place, but propagates outward along\na circle. If you continue dropping pebbles in the pond, you\nsee circles rapidly moving outward from the point where the\nwater surface is disturbed. It gives a feeling as if the water is\nmoving outward from the point of disturbance. If you put\nsome cork pieces on the disturbed surface, it is seen that\nthe cork pieces move up and down but do not move away\nfrom the centre of disturbance. This shows that the water\nmass does not flow outward with the circles, but rather a\nmoving disturbance is created. Similarly, when we speak,\nthe sound moves outward from us, without any flow of air\nfrom one part of the medium to another . The disturbances\nproduced in air are much less obvious and only our ears or\na microphone can detect them. These patterns, which move\nwithout the actual physical transfer or flow of matter as a\nwhole, are called waves.

Some of the famous\nscientists associated with the physics of wave\nmotion are Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695),\nRobert Hooke and Isaac Newton. The\nunderstanding of physics of waves followed the\nphysics of oscillations of masses tied to springs\nand physics of the simple pendulum.

As a practical example of this situation,\nconsider a stationary train at a railway station.\nDifferent bogies of the train are coupled to each\nother through a spring coupling. When an\nengine is attached at one end, it gives a push to\nthe bogie next to it; this push is transmitted from\none bogie to another without the entire train\nbeing bodily displaced.\nNow let us consider the propagation of sound\nwaves in air.

Pressure is force per unit area,\nso there is a restoring force proportional to\nthe disturbance, just like in a spring. In this\ncase, the quantity similar to extension or\ncompression of the spring is the change in\ndensity. If a region is compressed, the molecules\nin that region are packed together, and they tend\nto move out to the adjoining region, thereby\nincreasing the density or creating compression\nin the adjoining region. Consequently, the air\nin the fir st region undergoes rarefaction. If a\nregion is comparatively rarefied the surrounding\nair will rush in making the rarefaction move to\nthe adjoining region.

Later in this\nchapter, we shall obtain specific expressions for\nthe speed of mechanical waves in some media.\n14.4.1 Speed of a Transverse Wave on\nStretched String\nThe speed of a mechanical wave is determined\nby the restoring force setup in the medium when\nit is disturbed and the inertial properties (mass\ndensity) of the medium. The speed is expected to\nbe directly related to the former and inversely to\nthe latter. For waves on a string, the r estoring\nforce is provided by the tension T in the string.\nThe inertial property will in this case be linear\nmass density \n\u00b5, which is mass m  of the string\ndivided by its length L. Using Newton\u2019s Laws of\nMotion, an exact formula for the wave speed on\na string can be derived, but this derivation is\noutside the scope of this book. W e shall,\ntherefore, use dimensional analysis. We already\nknow that dimensional analysis alone can never\nyield the exact formula.

It turns out that wave pulses\ncontinue to retain their identities after they have\ncrossed. However, during the time they overlap,\nthe wave pattern is different from either of the\npulses. Figure 14.9 shows the situation when\ntwo pulses of equal and opposite shapes move\ntowards each other. When the pulses overlap,\nthe resultant displacement is the algebraic sum\nof the displacement due to each pulse. This is\nknown as the principle of superposition of waves.\nAccording to this principle, each pulse moves\nas if others are not present. The constituents of\nthe medium, therefore, suffer displacments due\nto both and since the displacements can be\npositive and negative, the net displacement is\nan algebraic sum of the two.

Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular\nto the direction of wave propagation.\n3. Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the\ndirection of wave propagation.\n4. Progressive wave is a wave that moves fr om one point of medium to another .\n5. The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given\nby\ny (x, t) = a sin (kx \u2013 \u03c9t + \u03c6)\nwhere a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, \u03c9 is the angular\nfrequency, (kx \u2013 \u03c9t + \u03c6) is the phase, and \u03c6 is the phase constant or phase angle.\n6. Wavelength \u03bb of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of\nthe same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between\ntwo  consecutive nodes or antinodes.\n7. Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium\ntakes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency \u03c9\nthrough the relation\nT = 2\u03c0\n\u03c9\n8. Frequency v of a wave is defined as 1/T and is related to angular frequency by\n2\n\u03c9\u03bd = \u03c0\n9. Speed of a progressive wave is given by \nk Tv \u03c9 \u03bb \u03bb\u03bd= = =\n10.

The former involves motion of air from one place to the other.  The\nlatter involves compressions and rarefactions of layers of air.\n2. In a wave, energy and not the matter is transferred from one point to the other .\n3. In a mechanical wave, energy transfer takes place because of the coupling through\nelastic forces between neighbouring oscillating parts of the medium.\n4. Transverse waves can propagate only in medium with shear modulus of elasticity,\nLongitudinal waves need bulk modulus of elasticity and are therefore, possible in all\nmedia, solids, liquids and gases.\n5. In a harmonic progressive wave of a given frequency, all particles have the same\namplitude but different phases at a given instant of time.  In a stationary wave, all\nparticles between two nodes have the same phase at a given instant but have different\namplitudes.\n6. Relative to an observer at rest in a medium the speed of a mechanical wave in that\nmedium (v) depends only on elastic and other properties (such as mass density) of\nthe medium. It does not depend on the velocity of the source.\nEXERCISES\n14.1 A string of mass 2.50 kg is under a tension of 200 N. The length of the stretched\nstring is 20.0 m.

Along the way,\nyou will find out why blacksmiths heat the ir on ring before\nfitting on the rim of a wooden wheel of a horse cart and why\nthe wind at the beach often reverses direction after the sun\ngoes down. You will also learn what happens when water boils\nor freezes, and its temperature does not change during these\nprocesses even though a great deal of heat is flowing into or\nout of it.\n10.2  TEMPERATURE AND HEAT\nWe can begin studying ther mal pr operties of matter with\ndefinitions of temperature and heat. Temperature is a relative\nmeasure, or indication of hotness or coldness. A hot utensil\nis said to have a high temperatur e, and ice cube to have a\nlow temperature. An object that has a higher temperatur e\nthan another object is said to be hotter . Note that hot and\ncold ar\ne relative terms, like tall and short. We can perceive\ntemperature by touch.

Gases are poor thermal conductors, while\nliquids have conductivities intermediate between\nsolids and gases.\nHeat conduction may be described\nquantitatively as the time rate of heat flow in a\nmaterial for a given temperatur e dif ference.\nConsider a metallic bar of length L and uniform\ncross-section A with its two ends maintained at\ndifferent temperatures. This can be done, for\nexample, by putting the ends in thermal contact\nwith large reservoirs at temperatures, say, TC and\nTD, respectively (Fig. 10.14).

In natural\nconvection, gravity plays an important part.\nWhen a fluid is heated from below, the hot part\nexpands and, ther efore, becomes less dense.\nBecause of buoyancy, it rises and the upper\ncolder part replaces it. This again gets heated,\nrises up and is replaced by the relatively colder\npart of the fluid. The process goes on. This mode\nof heat transfer is evidently different from\nconduction. Convection involves bulk transport\nof different parts of the fluid.\n     In forced convection, material is forced to move\nby a pump or by some other physical means. The\ncommon  examples of forced convection systems\nare forced-air heating systems in home, the\nhuman circulatory system, and the cooling\nsystem of an automobile engine. In the human\nbody, the heart acts as the pump that circulates\nblood through different parts of the body,\ntransferring heat by forced convection and\nmaintaining it at a uniform temperature.\nNatural convection is responsible for many\nfamiliar phenomena. During the day, the\nground heats up more quickly than large bodies\nof water do. This occurs both because water has\na greater specific heat capacity and because\nmixing currents disperse the absorbed heat",

As a result, the\nwarm air rises (air currents) and the other air\nmoves (winds) to fill the space-creating a sea\nbreeze near a lar ge body of water . Cooler air\ndescends, and a thermal convection cycle is set\nup, which transfers heat away from the land.\nAt night, the ground loses its heat more quickly,\nand the water surface is warmer than the land.\nAs a result, the cycle is reveresed (Fig. 10.17).\nThe other example of natural convection is\nthe steady sur face wind on the earth blowing\nin fr om north-east towar ds the equator , the\nso-called trade wind.

These modes\nof heat transfer cannot operate between bodies\nseparated by a distance in vacuum. But the\nearth does receive heat from the Sun across a\nhuge distance. Similarly, we quickly feel the\nwarmth of the fire nearby even though air\nconducts poorly and before convection takes\nsome time to set in. The third mechanism for\nheat transfer needs no medium; it is called\nradiation and the energy so transferred by\nelectromagnetic waves is called radiant energy.\nIn an electromagnetic wave, electric and\nmagnetic fields oscillate in space and time. Like\nany wave, electromagnetic waves can have\ndifferent wavelengths and can travel in vacuum\nwith the same speed, namely the speed of light\ni.e., 3 \u00d7 108 m s\u20131 . You will learn these matters in\nmore detail later, but you now know why heat\ntransfer by radiation does not need any medium\nand why it is so fast. This is how heat is\ntransferred to the earth from the Sun through\nempty space. All bodies emit radiant energy,\nwhether they are solid, liquid or gas. The\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by a body by\nvirtue of its temperature, like radiation by a red\nhot iron or light from a filament lamp is called\nthermal radiation.\nWhen this ther mal radiation falls on other\nbodies, it is partly reflected and partly absorbed.\nThe amount of heat that a body can absorb by\nradiation depends on the colour of the body.",

Heat is a form of energy that flows between a body and its surrounding medium by\nvirtue of temperatur e difference between them. The degr ee of hotness of the body is\nquantitatively r epresented by temperatur e.\n2. A temperature-measuring device (thermometer) makes use of some measurable property\n(called thermometric property) that changes with temperature. Different thermometers\nlead to different temperature scales. To construct a temperature scale, two fixed points\nare chosen and assigned some arbitrary values of temperatur e. The two numbers fix\nthe origin of the scale and the size of its unit.\n3. The Celsius temperatur e (tC) and the Far enheit temperare (tF)are related by\ntF = (9/5) tC + 32\n4. The ideal gas equation connecting pressure (P), volume (V) and absolute temperature (T)\nis :\nPV = \u00b5RT\nwhere \u00b5 is the number of moles and R is the universal gas constant.",

In the original Celsius scale, these latter fixed points\nwere exactly at 0  \u00b0C and 100  \u00b0C (by choice), but now the triple point of water is the\npreferred choice for the fixed point, because it has a unique temperatur e.\n2.

Liquids and gases can  flow\nand are ther efore, called  fluids.  It is this pr operty that\ndistinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way.\nFluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of\nair and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water.  Water\nis not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian\nbody constitute mostly of water. All the  processes occurring\nin living beings including plants are mediated by fluids. Thus\nunderstanding the behaviour and pr operties of fluids is\nimportant.\nHow are fluids different from solids? What is common in\nliquids and gases? Unlike  a solid, a fluid has no definite\nshape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume,\nwhereas a gas fills the entir e volume of its container . We\nhave learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids\ncan be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas\ndepends on the str ess or pr essure acting on it. When we\ntalk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume\nunder atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases\nand solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change\nin volume due to  change of external pressure is rather small.\nIn other wor ds solids and liquids have much lower\ncompressibility as compared to gases.\nShear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its",

Such\neveryday experiences convince us that both the\nforce and its coverage area are important. Smaller\nthe area on which the force acts, greater is the\nimpact. This impact is known as pressure.\nWhen an object is submer ged in a fluid at\nrest, the fluid exerts a force on its surface. This\nforce is always nor mal to the object\u2019s sur face.\nThis is so because if there wer\ne a component of\nforce parallel to the surface, the object will also\nexert a for ce on the fluid parallel to it; as a\nconsequence of Newton\u2019s thir d law. This for ce\nwill cause the fluid to flow parallel to the surface.\nSince the fluid is at r est, this cannot happen.\nHence, the force exerted by the fluid at rest has\nto be perpendicular to the sur face in contact\nwith it. This is shown in Fig.9.1(a).\nThe normal force exerted by the fluid at a point\nmay be measured. An idealised form of one such\npressure-measuring device is shown in Fig.\n9.1(b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with\na spring that is calibrated to measure the force\nacting on the piston. This device is placed at a\npoint inside the fluid. The inward force exerted\nby the fluid on the piston is balanced by the\noutward spring force and is thereby measured.\nIf F is the magnitude of this normal force on the\npiston of area A then the average pressure Pav\nis defined as the nor mal force acting per unit\narea.\nP F\nAav =              (9.1)",

The study\nof the fluids in motion is known as fluid\ndynamics. When a water tap is turned on slowly,\nthe water flow is smooth initially, but loses its\nsmoothness when the speed of the outflow is\nincreased. In studying the motion of fluids, we\nfocus our attention on what is happening to\nvarious fluid particles at a particular point in\nspace at a particular time. The flow of the fluid\nis said to be steady if at any given point, the\nvelocity of each passing fluid particle remains\nconstant in time. This does not mean that the\nvelocity at different points in space is same. The\nvelocity of a particular particle may change as it\nmoves from one point to another. That is, at some\nother point the particle may have a different\nvelocity, but every other particle which passes\nthe second point behaves exactly as the previous\nparticle that has just passed that point. Each\nparticle follows a smooth path, and the paths of\nthe particles do not cross each other.\nFig. 9.7 The meaning of streamlines.

This arises due to the fact that in a fluid\nflow, the different layers of the fluid flow with\ndifferent velocities. These layers exert frictional\nforces on each other resulting in a loss of energy.\nThis property of the fluid is called viscosity and\nis discussed in more detail in a later section. The\nlost kinetic energy of the fluid gets converted into\nheat energy. Thus, Bernoulli\u2019s equation ideally\napplies to fluids with zero viscosity or non-\nviscous fluids.

In practice,\nit has a large number of useful applications and\ncan help explain a wide variety of phenomena\nfor low viscosity incompressible fluids.\nBernoulli\u2019s equation also does not hold for non-\nsteady or turbulent flows, because in that\nsituation velocity and pressure are constantly\nfluctuating in time.\nWhen a fluid is at rest i.e., its velocity is zero\neverywhere, Bernoulli\u2019s equation becomes\nP1 + \u03c1gh1 = P2 + \u03c1gh2\n(P1\u2212 P2) = \u03c1g (h2 \u2212 h1)\nwhich is same as Eq.

However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was\nrealised that they were intimately related. During a lecture demonstration\nin the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed\nthat a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby\nmagnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found\nthat the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which\nhas the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the\nwire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when the\ncurrent is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the\nearth\u2019s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the\ncurrent reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deflection\nincreases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the\nwire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in\nconcentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)]. Oersted\nconcluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field\nin the surrounding space .\nFollowing this, there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws\nobeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by\nChapter Four\nMOVING CHARGES\nAND MAGNETISM\nReprint 2025-26",

We have learnt  in Mechanics (see Class XI book, Chapter\n5) that a force on a particle does work if  the force has a component along\n(or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle. In the case of motion\nof a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the\nvelocity of the particle. So no work is done and no change in the magnitude\nof the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may be\nchanged). [Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric field, qE,\nwhich can have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and thus\ncan transfer energy in addition to momentum.]\nWe shall consider motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic\nfield. First consider the case of v perpendicular to B.  The\nperpendicular force, q v \u00d7 B, acts as a centripetal force and\nproduces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nThe particle will describe a circle if v and B are  perpendicular\nto each other (Fig. 4.5).\nIf velocity has a component along B, this component\nremains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will\nnot be affected by the magnetic field. The motion in a plane\nperpendicular to B is as before a circular one, thereby producing\na helical motion (Fig. 4.6).\nYou have already learnt in earlier classes (Se e Class XI,",

The total force on a charge q moving with velocity v in the presence of\nmagnetic and electric fields B and E, respectively is called the Lorentz\nforce. It is given by the expression:\nF = q (v \u00d7 B + E)\nThe magnetic force q (v \u00d7 B) is normal to v and work done by it is zero.\n2. A straight conductor of length l and carrying a steady current I\nexperiences a force F in a uniform external magnetic field B,\nF = I l \u00d7 B\nwhere|l| =  l and the direction of l is given by the direction of the\ncurrent.\n3. In a uniform magnetic field B, a charge q executes a circular orbit in\na plane normal to B. Its frequency of uniform circular motion is called\nthe cyclotron frequency and is given by:\n2\nc\nq B\nm\u03bd = \u03c0\nThis frequency is independent of the particle\u2019s speed and radius. This\nfact is exploited in a machine, the cyclotron, which is used to\naccelerate charged particles.\n4.

We restricted ourselves to simpler\nsituations of rigid bodies.  A rigid body generally means a\nhard solid object having a definite shape and size.  But in\nreality,  bodies can be stretched, compr\nessed and bent. Even\nthe  appr eciably  rigid  steel bar can be defor med when a\nsufficiently large external force is applied on it.  This means\nthat solid bodies are not perfectly rigid.\nA solid has  definite shape and size. In order to change (or\ndeform) the shape or size of a body, a for ce  is r equired. If\nyou stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the\nlength of the spring incr eases slightly. When you leave the\nends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape.  The\nproperty of a body, by virtue of  which  it tends to regain its\noriginal size and shape when the applied force is removed, is\nknown as elasticity and the defor mation caused is known\nas elastic deformation. However, if you apply force to a lump\nof putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their\nprevious shape, and they get per manently deformed.

The\ndeformation may not be noticeable visually in\nmany materials but it is there. When a body is\nsubjected to a deforming force, a restoring force\nis developed in the body. This restoring force is\nequal in magnitude but opposite in direction to\nthe applied force. The restoring force per unit area\nis known as stress.  If F is the force applied normal\nto the cross\u2013section and A  is the  area of cross\nsection of  the body,\nMagnitude of the stress = F/A (8.1)\nThe SI unit of stress is  N m \u20132 or pascal (Pa)\nand its dimensional formula is [ ML\u20131T\u20132 ].\nThere are three ways in which a solid may\nchange its dimensions when an exter nal force\nacts on it. These are shown in Fig. 8.1. In\nFig.8.1(a), a cylinder is stretched by two equal\nforces applied normal to its cross-sectional area.\nThe restoring force per unit area  in this case is\ncalled tensile stress . If the cylinder is\ncompressed under the action of applied forces,\nthe restoring force per unit area is known as\ncompressive stress . Tensile or compressive\nstress can also be termed as longitudinal stress.\nIn both the cases, ther e is a change in the\nlength of the cylinder.

This leads to the decrease in the\nvolume of the body thus producing a strain called\nvolume strain [Eq. (8.5)]. The ratio of hydraulic\nstress to the corresponding hydraulic strain is\ncalled bulk modulus. It is denoted by symbol B.\nB = \u2013 p/(\u2206V/V) (8.12)\nThe negative sign indicates the fact that with\nan increase in pressure, a decrease in volume\noccurs. That is, if p is positive, \u2206V is negative.\nThus for a system in equilibrium, the value of\nbulk modulus B is always positive. SI unit of\nbulk modulus is the same as that of pr essure\ni.e., N m\u20132 or Pa. The bulk moduli of a few common\nmaterials are given in Table 8.3.\nThe reciprocal of the bulk modulus is called\ncompressibility and is denoted by k.

Stress is the restoring force per unit area and strain is the fractional change in dimension.\nIn general there are three types of stresses (a) tensile stress \u2014 longitudinal stress\n(associated with stretching) or compressive stress (associated with compression),\n(b) shearing stress, and (c) hydraulic stress.\n2. For small deformations, stress is directly proportional to the strain for many materials.\nThis is known as Hooke\u2019s law. The constant of proportionality is called modulus of\nelasticity. Three elastic moduli viz., Young\u2019s modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus\nare used to describe the elastic behaviour of objects as they respond to deforming forces\nthat act on them.\nA class of solids called elastomers does not obey Hooke\u2019s law.\n3. When an object is under tension or compression, the Hooke\u2019s law takes the form\n F/A  = Y\u2206L/L\nwhere  \u2206L/L is the tensile or compressive strain of the object, F is the magnitude of the\napplied force causing the strain, A is the cross-sectional area over which F is applied\n(perpendicular to A) and Y is the Young\u2019s modulus for the object. The stress is F/A.\n4. A pair of forces when applied parallel to the upper and lower faces, the solid deforms so\nthat the upper face moves sideways with respect to the lower. The horizontal displacement\n\u2206L of the upper face is perpendicular to the vertical height L. This type of deformation is\ncalled shear \nand the corresponding stress is the shearing stress.

Such currents occur\nnaturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in\nwhich charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,\nsometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not\nsteady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow\nin a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a\ncell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we\nshall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.\n3.2  ELECTRIC CURRENT\nImagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both\nthe positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward\nacross the area. In a given time interval t, let q+ be the net amount (i.e.,\nforward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward\ndirection across the area. Similarly, let q\u2013  be the net amount of negative\ncharge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount\nof charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time\ninterval t, then, is q = q+\u2013  q\u2013 .

Ohm in\n1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents\nwas discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing\nand let V be the potential difference between the ends of the conductor.\nThen Ohm\u2019s law states that\n     V \u00b5 I\nor, V = R I (3.3)\nwhere the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the\nconductor. The SI units of resistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol\nW. The resistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor\nbut also on the dimensions of the conductor. The dependence of R on the\ndimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows.\nConsider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab of\nlength l and cross sectional area A [Fig. 3.2(a)]. Imagine placing two such\nidentical slabs side by side [Fig. 3.2(b)], so that the length of the\ncombination is 2l. The current flowing through the  combination is the\nsame as that flowing through either of the slabs. If V is the potential\ndifference across the ends of the first slab, then V is also the potential",

The deviations broadly are one or more of the following\ntypes:\n(a) V ceases to be proportional to I (Fig. 3.5).\n(b) The relation between V and I depends on the sign of V. In\nother words, if I is the current for a certain V, then reversing\nthe direction of V keeping its magnitude fixed, does not\nproduce a current of the same magnitude as I in the opposite direction\n(Fig. 3.6).

A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.10.\nWe can qualitatively understand the temperatur e dependence of\nresistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation,\nresistivity of a material is given by\n2\n1 m\nn e\u03c1 \u03c3 \u03c4= = (3.27)\nr thus depends inversely both on the number n of free electrons per unit\nvolume and on the average time t between collisions. As we increase\ntemperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of\ncurrent, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time\nof collisions t, thus decreases with temperature.\nIn a metal, n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable\nextent and thus the decrease in the value of t with rise in temperature\ncauses r to increase as we have observed.\nFor insulators and semiconductors, however , n incr eases with\ntemperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in t in\nEq.(3.23) so that for such materials, r decreases with temperature.\nExample 3.3  An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating\nelement.

In this manner , the curr ent in all\nthe 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, using\nKirchhoff\u2019s first rule and the symmetry in the problem.\nNext take a closed loop, say, ABCC \u00a2EA, and apply Kirchhoff\u2019s second\nrule:\n\u2013IR  \u2013 (1/2) IR \u2013 IR + \ne = 0\nwhere R is the resistance of each edge and e the emf of battery.

It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a\nbox, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged\nobject touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to\nthe leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of\nthe amount of charge.\nTry to understand why material bodies acquire charge. You know that\nall matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the\nmaterials are electrically neutral,  they do contain charges; but their charges\nare exactly balanced. Forces that hold the molecules together, forces that\nhold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated\nwith surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the\nforces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and\nit encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is\ntherefore essential that we learn more about such a force.\nTo electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of\ncharge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this\nexcess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being\nless tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred\nfrom one body to the other.  A body can thus be charged positively by\nlosing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively",

No new charge is\ncreated in the process of rubbing.

The proton and electron thus created have\nequal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after\nthe creation.\n1.4.3  Quantisation of charge\nExperimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples\nof a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always\ngiven by\nq = ne\nwhere n is any integer, positive or negative. This basic unit of charge is\nthe charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge\non an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is\nwritten as \u2013e and that on a proton as +e.\nThe fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed\nas quantisation of charge. There are a large number of situations in physics\nwhere certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge\nwas first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by\nEnglish experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by\nMillikan in 1912.\nIn the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a\ncoulomb and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms\nthe unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a\nsubsequent chapter.

Since e = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u201319  C, a charge\nof magnituOde, say 1 mC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic\ncharge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in\nunits of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous\nvalues. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no\npractical consequence and can be ignored. However, at the microscopic\nlevel, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds\nof e, i.e.,  they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and\nquantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale\ninvolved that is very important.\nExample 1.1  If 10 9 electrons move out of a body to another body\nevery second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C\non the other body?\nSolution In one second 10 9 electrons move out of the body.

Consider a\nsystem of n stationary charges q1, q2, q3, ..., qn in vacuum.\nWhat is the force on q1 due to q2, q3, ..., qn? Coulomb\u2019s law is\nnot enough to answer this question.  Recall that forces of\nmechanical origin add according to the parallelogram law of\naddition. Is the same true for forces of electrostatic origin?\nExperimentally, it is verified that force on any charge due\nto a number of other charges is the vector sum of all the forces\non that charge due to the  other charges, taken one at a time.\nThe individual forces are unaffected due to the presence of\nother charges. This is termed as the principle of superposition.\nTo better understand the concept, consider a system of\nthree charges q1, q2 and q3, as shown in Fig. 1.5(a). The force\non one charge, say q1, due to two other charges q2, q3 can\ntherefore be obtained by performing a vector addition of the\nforces due to each one of these charges. Thus, if the force on q1\ndue to q2 is denoted by F12, F12 is given by Eq.

The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q 1\nproduces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed\nc, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts\nfor the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be\ndetected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as\nphysical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an\nindependent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws\nof their own. They can also transport energy.

(By permanent dipole, we\nmean that p exists  irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)\nThere is a force qE on q and a force \u2013qE on \u2013q. The net force on\nthe dipole is zer o, since E is unifor m. However, the char ges are\nseparated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque\non the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is\nindependent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of\neach force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular\ndistance between the two antiparallel forces).\nMagnitude of torque = q E \u00d7 2 a sin\nq\n       = 2 q a E sinq\nIts direction is normal to the plane of the paper, coming out of it.\nThe magnitude of p \u00d7 E is also p E sinq and its direction\nis normal to the paper, coming out of it. Thus,\nt tt tt  = p \u00d7 E (1.22)\nThis torque will tend to align the dipole with the field\nE. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.\nWhat happens if the field is not uniform?

The\ngeneral case is involved, so let us consider the simpler\nsituations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In\neither case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force\non the dipole if E is not uniform.\nFigure 1.20 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that\nwhen p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the\ndirection of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,\nthe net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing\nfield. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p\nwith respect to E.\nThis brings us to a common observation in frictional\nelectricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of\npaper.

One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the\nmathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For\nmany purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms of discrete\ncharges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For\nexample, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify\nthe charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged\nconstituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element DS (Fig. 1.21)\non the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic\nscale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and\nspecify the charge DQ on that element. We then define a surface charge\ndensity \ns at the area element by\nQ\nS\u03c3 \u0394= \u0394 (1.23)\nWe can do this at different points on the conductor and thus arrive at\na continuous function s, called the surface charge density.

You may choose any Gaussian sur face and\napply Gauss\u2019s law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface\npass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due\nto a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of\nany charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without\nany bound.) However , the Gaussian sur face can pass thr ough a\ncontinuous charge distribution.\n(v) Gauss\u2019s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the\nelectrostatic field when the system has some symmetry.  This is\nfacilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.\n(vi) Finally, Gauss\u2019s law is based on the inverse square dependence on\ndistance contained in the Coulomb\u2019s law.

The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb\u2019s law is a matter of\nchoice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb\u2019s law. In SI\nunits, however, what is defined is the unit of current (A) via its magnetic\neffect (Ampere\u2019s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined\nby (1C = 1 A s).

When an external force does work in taking a body from a\npoint to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force,\nthat work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external\nforce is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing\nan equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and\npotential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called\nconservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of\nconservative forces.\nCoulomb force between two (stationary) charges is also a conservative\nforce. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence\non distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants \u2013 the\nmasses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb\u2019s\nlaw. Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitational\nfield, we can define electrostatic potential energy of a charge in an\nelectrostatic field.\nConsider an electrostatic field E E E  E E due to some charge configuration.\nFirst, for simplicity, consider the field E EE EE due to a charge \nQ placed at the\norigin.

Second, in bringing the charge q from\nR to P, we apply an external force Fext just enough to\ncounter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fext= \u2013 FE).\nThis means there is no net force on or acceleration of\nthe charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is\nbrought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In\nthis situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work\ndone by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential\nenergy of the charge q.

We then determine the potential due\nto each volume element and sum (strictly speaking , integrate) over all\nsuch contributions, and thus determine the potential due to the entire\ndistribution.\nWe have seen in Chapter 1 that for a uniformly charged spherical shell,\nthe electric field outside the shell is as if the entire charge is concentrated\nat the centre. Thus, the potential outside the shell is given by\n0\n1\n4\nqV r\u03b5= \u03c0    ( )r R\u2265 [2.19(a)]\nwhere q is the total charge on the shell and R its radius. The electric field\ninside the shell is zero. This implies (Section 2.6) that potential is constant\ninside the shell (as no work is done in moving a charge inside the shell),\nand, therefore, equals its value at the surface, which is\n0\n1\n4\nqV R\u03b5= \u03c0 [2.19(b)]\nExample 2.2  Two charges 3 \u00d7 10 \u20138  C and \u20132 \u00d7 10 \u20138  C are located\n15 cm apart. At what point on the line joining the two charges is the\nelectric potential zero? Take the potential at infinity to be zero.\nSolution Let us take the origin O at the location of the positive charge.\nThe line joining the two charges is taken to be the x-axis;  the negative\ncharge is taken to be on the right side of the origin (Fig. 2.7).\nFIGURE 2.7",

Thus, equipotential\nsurfaces of a single point charge are concentric spherical surfaces centred\nat the charge.\nNow the electric field lines for a single charge q are radial lines starting\nfrom or ending at the charge, depending on whether q is positive or negative.\nClearly, the electric field at every point is normal to the equipotential surface\npassing through that point. This is true in general: for any charge\nconfiguration, equipotential sur face thr ough a point is nor mal to the\nelectric field at that point. The proof of this statement is simple.\nIf the field were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would\nhave non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test charge\nagainst the direction of the component of the field, work would have to\nbe done. But this is in contradiction to the definition of an equipotential\nsurface: there is no potential difference between any two points on the\nsurface and no work is required to move a test charge on the surface.\nThe electric field must, therefore, be normal to the equipotential surface\nat every point.

But here we address this question again\nto clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7.\nThe main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential\nenergy of a charge (or charges) in an external field. The external field E is\nnot produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish to\ncalculate. E is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).The\nexternal sources may be known, but often they are unknown or\nunspecified; what is specified is the electric field E or the electrostatic\npotential V due to the exter nal sources. We assume that the char ge q\ndoes not significantly affect the sources producing the external field. This\nis true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other\nunspecified forces. Even if q is finite, its influence on the external sources\nmay still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far away\nat infinity produce a finite field E in the region of interest. Note again that\nwe are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge \nq\n(and later, a system of charges) in the external field; we are not interested\nin the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric field.\nThe external electric field E and the corresponding external potential\nV may vary from point to point.

The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in\nthe static situation\nA neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges\nin every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged,\nthe excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation.\nThis follows from the Gauss\u2019s law. Consider any arbitrary volume element\nv inside a conductor . On the closed sur face S bounding the volume\nelement v, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through S\nis zero. Hence, by Gauss\u2019s law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. But\nthe surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume v can be\nmade vanishingly small. This means there is no net charge at any point\ninside the conductor, and any excess charge must reside at the surface.\n4.

In contrast to conductors,\nthey have no (or negligible number of ) charge carriers. Recall from Section\n2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an\nexternal electric field. The free charge carriers move\nand charge distribution in the conductor adjusts\nitself in such a way that the electric field due to\ninduced charges opposes the external field within\nthe conductor. This happens until, in the static\nsituation, the two fields cancel each other and the\nnet electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a\ndielectric, this free movement of charges is not\npossible. It turns out that the external field induces\ndipole moment by stretching or re-orienting\nmolecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all\nthe molecular dipole moments is net charges on the\nsurface of the dielectric which produce a field that\nopposes the external field. Unlike in a conductor,\nhowever, the opposing field so induced does not\nexactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it.\nThe extent of the effect depends on the\nnature of the dielectric.

[As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the\ninsulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors.]  The SI unit of\ncapacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt-1) or 1 F = 1 C V\u20131 . A capacitor\nwith fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as ---||---, while the one with\nvariable capacitance is shown as  \n.\nEquation (2.38) shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q. This\nmeans a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge\nQ at a relatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potential\ndifference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strong\nelectric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so\nproduced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge\non the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of the\ncapacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the\nintervening medium.\nThe maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand\nwithout break-down (of its insulating property) is called its dielectric\nstrength; for air it is about 3 \u00d7 10 6 Vm\u20131 . For a separation between\nconductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential\ndifference of 3 \u00d7 104 V between the conductors.

Put differently, there is a limit\nto the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without\nsignificant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most common\nunits are its sub-multiples 1 mF = 10\u20136  F, 1 nF = 10\u20139  F, 1 pF = 10\u201312  F,\netc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of most\nac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7.\n2.12  THE PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITOR\nA parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting\nplates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25).

A cavity inside a conductor is shielded from outside electrical influences.\nIt is worth noting that electrostatic shielding does not work the other\nway round; that is, if you put charges inside the cavity, the exterior of\nthe conductor is not shielded from the fields by the inside charges.\nEXERCISES\n2.1 Two charges 5 \u00d7 10 \u20138 C and \u20133 \u00d7 10 \u20138 C are located 16 cm apart. At\nwhat point(s) on the line joining the two charges is the electric\npotential zero? Take the potential at infinity to be zero.\n2.2 A regular hexagon of side 10 cm has a charge 5 mC at each of its\nvertices. Calculate the potential at the centre of the hexagon.\n2.3 Two charges 2  m C and \u20132 mC are placed at points A and B 6 cm\napart.\n(a) Identify an equipotential surface of the system.\n(b) What is the direction of the electric field at every point on this\nsurface?\n2.4 A spherical conductor of radius 12 cm has a charge of 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u20137 C\ndistributed uniformly on its surface. What is the electric field\n(a) inside the sphere\n(b) just outside the sphere\n(c) at a point 18 cm from the centre of the sphere?\n2.5 A parallel plate capacitor with air between the plates has a\ncapacitance of 8 pF (1pF = 10 \u201312  F). What will be the capacitance if\nthe distance between the plates is reduced by half, and the space\nbetween them is filled with a substance of dielectric constant 6?\n2.6 Three capacitors each of capacitance 9 pF are connected in series.",
