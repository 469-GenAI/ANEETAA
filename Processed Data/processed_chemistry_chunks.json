They help us in making difficult calculations\neasy. In Chemistry, logarithm values are required in solving problems of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics,\nelectrochemistry, etc. W e shall first intr oduce this concept, and discuss the laws, which will have to be\nfollowed in working with logarithms, and then apply this technique to a number of problems to show\nhow it makes difficult calculations simple.\nWe know that\n23 = 8, 3 2 = 9, 5 3 = 125, 7 0 = 1\nIn general, for a positive real number a, and a rational number m, let a m = b,\nwhere b is a r eal number. In other wor ds\nthe m th power of base a is b.\nAnother way of stating the same fact is\nlogarithm of b to base a is m.\nIf for a positive real number a, a \u00b9 1\nam = b,\nwe say that m is the logarithm of b to the base a.\nWe write this as \nb\nalog m ,\uf03d\n\u201clog\u201d being the abbreviation of the word \u201clogarithm\u201d.\nThus, we have\n= =\n= =\n= =\n= =\n3\n2\n2\n3\n3\n5\n0\n7\nlog 8 3, Since2 8\nlog 9 2, Since3 9\nlog 125 3, Since5 125\nlog 1 0, Since7 1\nLaws of Logarithms\nIn the following discussion, we shall take logarithms to any base a, (a > 0 and a \u00b9 1)\nFirst Law:  log a\n (mn) = log am + log an\nProof: Suppose that log am = x and log an = y\nThen a x= m, a y = n\nHence mn = a x.ay = a x+y\nIt now follows from the definition of logarithms that\nloga (mn) = x + y = log a m \u2013 log a n",

Thus,\nthe use of these laws converts a problem of multiplication/division into a problem of addition/subtraction,\nwhich are far easier to perform than multiplication/division. That is why logarithms are so useful in\nall numerical computations.\nLogarithms to Base 10\nBecause number 10 is the base of writing numbers, it is very convenient to use logarithms to the base\n10. Some examples are:\nlog10\n 10 = 1, since 10 1 = 10\nlog10 100 = 2, since 10 2 = 100\nlog10 10000 = 4, since 10 4 = 10000\nlog10 0.01 = \u20132, since 10 \u20132  = 0.01\nlog10 0.001 = \u20133, since 10 \u20133\n  =  0.001\nand log 101 = 0 since 10 0 = 1\nThe above results indicate that if n is an integral power of 10, i.e., 1 followed by several zeros or\n1 preceded by several zeros immediately to the right of the decimal point, then log n can be easily found.\nIf n is not an integral power of 10, then it is not easy to calculate log n. But mathematicians have\nmade tables from which we can read off approximate value of the logarithm of any positive number",

If we can\nfind the characteristics and the mantissa of log n, we have to just add them to get log n.\nThus to find log n, all we have to do is as follows:\n1. Put n in the standard form, say\nn = m \u00d7 10\np\n, 1 \n<  m <10\n2. Read off the characteristic p of log n from this expression (exponent of 10).\n3. Look up log m from tables, which is being explained below.\n4. Write log n = p + log m\nIf the characteristic p of a number n is say, 2 and the mantissa is .4133, then we have log n = 2\n+ .4133 which we can write as 2.4133. If, however , the characteristic p of a number m is say \u20132 and the\nmantissa is .4123, then we have log m = \u20132 + .4123. W e cannot write this as \u20132.4123. (Why?) In or der\nto avoid this confusion we write 2  for  \u20132 and thus we write log m = 2.4123 .\nNow let us explain how to use the table of logarithms to find mantissas.

    "page_content": "The crystal field theory (CFT) is an electrostatic model which considers\nthe metal-ligand bond to be ionic arising purely from electrostatic\ninteractions between the metal ion and the ligand. Ligands are treated\nas point charges in case of anions or point dipoles in case of neutral\nmolecules. The five d orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion\nhave same energy, i.e., they are degenerate. This degeneracy is\nmaintained if a spherically symmetrical field of negative charges\nsurrounds the metal atom/ion. However , when this negative field is\ndue to ligands (either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules\nlike NH 3 and H 2O) in a complex, it becomes asymmetrical and the\ndegeneracy of the d orbitals is lifted. It results in splitting of the d\norbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal\nfield. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields.\n(a) Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities\nIn an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding\nthe metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in\nmetal d orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands.\nSuch a repulsion is more when the metal d orbital is directed towards\nthe ligand than when it is away from the ligand.

During the last fifty years, advances in this\narea, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and\nmolecular structure, novel breakthroughs in chemical industry  and vital\ninsights into the functioning of critical components of biological systems .\nThe first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure\nand bonding of a coor dination compound was made by A. W erner. His theory\npostulated the use of two types of linkages  ( primary and secondary ) by a\nmetal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry\nthese linkages are recognised as the ionisable (ionic) and non-ionisable (covalent)\nbonds, r espectively. Using the pr operty of isomerism, W erner pr edicted the\ngeometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities.\nThe V alence Bond Theory (VBT)  explains with r easonable success, the\nformation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds.\nIt, however , fails to pr ovide a quantitative interpr etation of magnetic behaviour\nand has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds.\nThe Crystal Field Theory (CFT)  to coordination compounds is based on\nthe effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges),",

We may at this stage, state the \nrules for the calculation of oxidation number. \nThese rules are: \n1.\n In elements, in the free or the uncombined \nstate, each atom bears an oxidation\n \nnumber of zero. Evidently each atom in \nH\n2, O2, Cl2, O3, P4, S8, Na, Mg, Al has the \noxidation number zero. \n2. For ions composed of only one atom, the \noxidation number is equal to the charge\n \non the ion.

In their \ncompounds all alkali metals have oxidation \nnumber of +1, and all alkaline earth metals \nhave an oxidation number of +2. Aluminium \nis regarded to have an oxidation number of \n+3 in all its compounds. \n3.\n The oxidation number of oxygen in most \ncompounds \nis \u20132.

It is popularly known as Stock \nnotation. According to this, the oxidation \nnumber is expressed by putting a Roman \nnumeral representing the oxidation number \nin parenthesis after the symbol of the metal in \nthe molecular formula. Thus aurous chloride \nand auric chloride are written as Au(I)Cl and \nAu(III)Cl\n3. Similarly, stannous chloride and \nstannic chloride are written as Sn(II)Cl 2 and \nSn(IV)Cl4. This change in oxidation number \nimplies change in oxidation state, which in \nturn helps to identify whether the species \nis present in oxidised form or reduced form. \nThus, Hg\n2(I)Cl2 is the reduced form of Hg(II) Cl2. \nProblem 7.3\nUsing Stock notation, represent the \nfollowing compounds :HAuCl4, Tl2O, FeO,   \nFe2O3, CuI, CuO, MnO and MnO2.    \nSolution \nBy applying various rules of calculating \nthe oxidation number of the desired \nelement in a compound, the oxidation \nnumber of each metallic element in its \ncompound is as follows:\nHAuCl\n4  \u2192 Au has 3\nTl2O \u2192 Tl has 1\nFeO \u2192 Fe has 2\nFe2O3 \u2192 Fe has 3 \nCuI \u2192 Cu has 1\nCuO \u2192 Cu has 2\nMnO \u2192 Mn has 2\nMnO2 \u2192 Mn has 4\nTherefore, these compounds may be\n \nrepresented as:\nHAu(III)Cl\n4, Tl 2(I)O, Fe(II)O, Fe 2(III)O3, \nCu(I)I, Cu(II)O, Mn(II)O, Mn(IV)O2.\nThe idea of oxidation number has been \ninvariably applied to define oxidation, \nreduction, oxidising agent (oxidant), reducing",

In fact, fluorine is \nso reactive that it attacks water and displaces \nthe oxygen of water : \n +1 \u20132           0        +1 \u20131        0\n2H2O (l) + 2F2 (g)  \u2192 4HF(aq)  + O2(g)     (7.40)\nIt is for this reason that the displacement \nreactions of chlorine, bromine and iodine \nusing fluorine are not generally carried out in \naqueous solution.

Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation \nnumber, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation, \nreduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reductant) have been viewed \naccording to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a \nconsistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in \nwriting equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories: \ncombination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of \nredox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide \napplications in the study of electrode processes and cells.\nEXERCISES\n7.1 Assign oxidation number to the underlined elements in each of the following species: \n (a) NaH2PO4 (b) NaHSO4 (c)  H4P2O7 (d)  K2MnO4\n (e) CaO2 (f)  NaBH4   (g)  H2S2O7 (h)  KAl(SO4)2.12 H2O\n7.2 What are \nthe oxidation number of the underlined elements in each of the following \nand how do you rationalise your results ? \n (a)  KI3        (b)  H2S4O6       (c)  Fe3O4      (d)  CH3CH2OH       (e)  CH3COOH\n7.3 Justify that the following reactions are r\nedox reactions: \n (a) CuO(s) + H2(g) \u2192 Cu(s) + H2O(g)\n (b) Fe2O3(s)  + 3CO(g) \u2192 2Fe(s)  + 3CO2(g)",

When several electrons occupy a set of\ndegenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum\npossible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds\nrule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability\nincreases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of\nexchange energy at d6 configuration.

Many of the\ntransition metal ions are paramagnetic.\nParamagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each\nsuch electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular\nmomentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the\nfirst series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular\nmomentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For\nthese, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired\nelectrons and is calculated by using the \u2018spin-only\u2019 formula, i.e.,\n\uf028 \uf029n n 2\uf06d \uf03d \uf02b\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and \u00b5 is the magnetic\nmoment in units of Bohr magneton (BM). A single unpaired electron\nhas a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM).\nThe magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of\nunpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful\nindication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom,\nmolecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the \u2018spin-only\u2019\nformula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row\ntransition elements are given in Table 4.7.

This is due to the comparatively\nsmaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the\navailability of d orbitals for bond formation.\nThe transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic\nactivity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple\noxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact\nProcess), finely divided iron (in Haber\u2019s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic\nHydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface\ninvolve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms\nof the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3d and\n4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the\nconcentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening\nof the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering).\nAlso because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states,\nthey become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(III) catalyses\nthe reaction between iodide and persulphate ions.\n2 I\n\u2013\n + S 2O8\n2\u2013\n \u00ae I2 + 2 SO 4\n2\u2013\nAn explanation of this catalytic action can be given as:\n2 Fe\n3+\n + 2 I\n\u2013\n \u00ae 2 Fe\n2+\n + I 2\n2 Fe\n2+\n + S 2O8\n2\u2013\n \u00ae 2 Fe\n3+\n + 2SO 4\n2\u2013\nInterstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms\nlike H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals.

Such\nalloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15\npercent of each other. Because of similar radii and other characteristics\nof transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The\nalloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points.

The almost identical radii of Zr\n(160 pm) and Hf (159 pm), a consequence of\nthe lanthanoid contraction, account for their\noccurrence together in nature and for the\ndifficulty faced in their separation.\nIn the lanthanoids, La(II) and Ln(III) compounds are predominant\nspecies. However , occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid\ncompounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation\nenthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled\nor filled f subshell.

The E\no\n value for Ce\n4+\n/ Ce\n3+\n is + 1.74 V which\nsuggests that it can oxidise water . However, the reaction rate is very\nslow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical r eagent.

The latter members could be\nprepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study\nmore difficult.\nAll the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of 7s\n2\nand variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons\nare formally added to 5 f, though not in thorium (Z = 90) but from Pa\nonwards the 5f orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in\nthe electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids\nare related to the stabilities of the f \n0\n, f \n7\n and f \n14 \noccupancies of the 5f\norbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are [Rn] 5 f \n7\n7s\n2 \nand\n[Rn] 5f\n 7\n6\nd\n1\n7s\n2\n. Although the 5f orbitals resemble the 4f orbitals in their\nangular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4f orbitals\nand hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent.\nThe general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well.\nThere is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M\n3+\n ions across the\nseries. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction (like lanthanoid\ncontraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element\nin this series resulting from poor shielding by 5f electrons.",

Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are\nslightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide\nlayers; alkalies have no action.\nThe magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those\nof the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility\nof the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5  f electrons is roughly\nparallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have\nhigher values.\nIt is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation\nenthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are\nlower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to\nbe expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will\npenetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore,\nbe more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4f electrons\nof the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less\nfirmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids.\nA comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to\ndifferent characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar",

The cell\npotential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction\npotentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive\nforce (emf)  of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It\nis now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and\nthe cathode on the right  while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic\ncell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal\nand electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between\nthe two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention\nthe emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the half-\ncell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the\nleft hand side i.e. ,\nEcell = Eright  \u2013 Eleft\nThis is illustrated by the following example:\nCell reaction:\nCu(s) + 2Ag +(aq) \u00be\u00ae Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4)\nHalf-cell reactions:\nCathode (reduction):   2Ag +(aq) + 2e\u2013  \u00ae 2Ag(s) (2.5)\nAnode (oxidation):    Cu(s)  \u00ae Cu2+(aq) + 2e \u2013 (2.6)\nIt can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction\n(2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper\nelectrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as:\nCu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+(aq)|Ag(s)\nand we have \nEcell = E right \u2013 Eleft = E Ag+\u00faAg \u2013 ECu2+\u00faCu (2.7)",

The values of standard\nelectrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are\ngiven in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode\nis greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to\nhydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative\nthen hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species.\nIt can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the\nhighest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F2) has the maximum\ntendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F \u2013 ) and therefore fluorine\ngas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest\nreducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating\nthat lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is\nthe most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be\nseen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard\nelectrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising\npower of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of\nthe species on the right hand side of the reaction.

After some time, we shall note that there is no change\nin the concentration of Cu 2+ and Zn 2+ ions and at the same time,\nvoltmeter gives zero reading.

Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic\nconductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell ,\nthe chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction  is converted into electrical\nwork, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a non-\nspontaneous redox reaction . The standard electrode potential  for any electrode\ndipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode\npotential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell\ncan be obtained by taking the difference of the standard potentials of cathode and\nanode (\n( )\no\ncellE  = Eo\ncathode \u2013 Eo\nanode). The standard potential of the cells are\nrelated to standard Gibbs energy ( DrGo = \u2013 nF ( )\no\ncellE ) and equilibrium constant",

If\nconcentration of X is increased to three times how will it affect the rate of\nformation of Y ?\nWe have alr eady noted that the concentration dependence of rate is\ncalled differential rate equation. It is not always convenient to\ndetermine the instantaneous rate, as it is measured by determination\nof slope of the tangent at point \u2018 t\u2019 in concentration vs time plot\n(Fig. 3.1).  This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence\nthe order of the reaction. In order to avoid this difficulty, we can\nintegrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly\nmeasured experimental data, i.e., concentrations at different times\nand rate constant.\nThe integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different\nreaction orders.

For example, MnO2\ncatalyses the following reaction so as to increase its rate considerably.\n2KClO3 MnO2\uf0be\uf0be\uf0be\uf0be \uf0ae 2 KCl + 3O 2\nThe word catalyst should not be used when the added substance\nreduces the rate of raction. The substance is then called inhibitor. The\naction of the catalyst can be explained by intermediate complex theory.\nAccording to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by\nforming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate\ncomplex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products\nand the catalyst.\nIt is believed that the catalyst provides an\nalternate pathway or reaction mechanism by\nreducing the activation energy between\nreactants and products and hence lowering\nthe potential energy barrier as shown in\nFig. 3.11.\nIt is clear from Arrhenius equation (3.18)\nthat lower the value of activation energy faster\nwill be the rate of a reaction.\nA small amount of the catalyst can catalyse\na large amount of reactants. A catalyst does\nnot alter Gibbs energy, DG of a reaction.  It\ncatalyses the spontaneous reactions but does\nnot catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is\nalso found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of\na reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it\ncatalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same",

The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration\nof reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time.

A number of factors such as temperature,\nconcentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction.  Mathematical\nrepresentation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law.  It has to be determined\nexperimentally and cannot be predicted.  Order of a reaction  with respect to\na reactant is the power of its concentration  which appears in the rate law\nequation.

Assume this system to be in\na state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of\ngaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same.\nNow increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the\ngas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)].

In the solution of a gas in a\nliquid, one of the components is so volatile that it exists as a gas and\nwe have already seen that its solubility is given by Henry\u2019s law which\nstates that\np = KH x.\nIf we compare the equations for Raoult\u2019s law and Henry\u2019s law, it\ncan be seen that the partial pressure of the volatile component or gas\nis directly proportional to its mole fraction in solution. Only the\nproportionality constant KH differs from p1\n0\n. Thus, Raoult\u2019s law becomes\na special case of Henry\u2019s law in which KH becomes equal to p1\n0\n.\nAnother important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in\nliquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in\nwater and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some\nphysical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of\npure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given\ntemperature vapourise and under\nequilibrium conditions the pressure exerted\nby the vapours of the liquid over the liquid\nphase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)].\nIn a pure liquid the entire surface is\noccupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a\nnon-volatile solute is added to a solvent to\ngive a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour\npressure of the solution is solely from the\nsolvent alone.

This vapour pressure of the\nsolution at a given temperature is found to\nbe lower than the vapour pressure of the\npure solvent at the same temperature.

Due to weakening of\ninteractions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult\u2019s law\n[Fig. 1.6 (a)].

An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline.\nIn this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic\nproton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the\nrespective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar\nmolecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone\nforms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult\u2019s law.\nThis is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen\nbond with acetone molecule as shown.\nThis decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each\ncomponent and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting",

Membranes having this kind\nof properties are known as semipermeable membranes\n (SPM).\nAssume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semi-\npermeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent\nand solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through\nthe membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow\nof the solvent is called osmosis.\nThe flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the\nsolvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane\ncan be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This\npressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic\npressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to\nthe concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to\nosmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules\nalways flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution.\nThe osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration\nof the solution.\n The osmotic pressure of a solution is the\nexcess pressure that must be applied to a\nsolution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the\npassage of solvent molecules through a\nsemipermeable membrane into the solution.

The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over\nother methods as pressure measurement is around the room\ntemperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality.\nAs compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large\neven for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for\ndetermination  of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for\nbiomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures\nand polymers have poor solubility.\nTwo solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given\ntemperature are called isotonic solutions .

Such a molar mass\nthat is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called\nas abnormal molar mass .\nIn 1880 van\u2019t Hoff introduced a factor i, known as the van\u2019t Hoff\nfactor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association.

Solutions are\nclassified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is\nexpressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The\ndissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry\u2019s law, according to which, at a\ngiven temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to\nthe partial pressure of the gas . The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by\nthe presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour\npressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult\u2019s law, according to which the relative\nlowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole\nfraction of a non-volatile solute pr esent in the solution . However, in a binary\nliquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another\nform of Raoult\u2019s law is used.

Thus, there are \nminimum repulsive forces, minimum energy \nand maximum stability of the molecule. On the \nother hand, when the staggered form changes \ninto the eclipsed form, the electron clouds of the \ncarbon \u2013 hydrogen bonds come closer to each \nother resulting in increase in electron cloud \nrepulsions. To check the increased repulsive \nforces, molecule will have to possess more \nenergy and thus has lesser stability. As already \nmentioned, the repulsive interaction between \nthe electron clouds, which affects stability of \na conformation, is called torsional strain.  \nMagnitude of torsional strain depends upon \nthe angle of rotation about C\u2013C bond. This \nangle is also called dihedral angle or torsional \nangle. Of all the conformations of ethane, the \nstaggered form has the least torsional strain \nand the eclipsed form, the maximum torsional \nstrain.

The remaining sp hybridised \norbital of each carbon atom undergoes \noverlapping along the internuclear axis with \nthe 1s  orbital of each of the two hydrogen \natoms forming two C-H sigma bonds. \nH-C-C bond angle is of 180\u00b0. Each carbon \nhas two unhybridised p orbitals which are \nperpendicular to each other as well as to the \nplane of the C-C sigma bond. The 2p orbitals \nof one carbon atom are parallel to the 2p \norbitals of the other carbon atom, which \nundergo lateral or sideways overlapping to \nform two pi (\u03c0) bonds between two carbon \natoms. Thus ethyne molecule consists of one \nC\u2013C \u03c3 bond,  two C\u2013H \u03c3 bonds and two C\u2013C \n\u03c0 bonds.

The molecular for\nmula of benzene, \nC6H6, indicates a high degree of unsaturation. \nThis molecular formula did not account for \nits relationship to corresponding alkanes, \nalkenes and alkynes which you have studied \nin earlier sections of this unit. What do you \nthink about its possible structure? Due to \nits unique properties and unusual stability, \nit took several years to assign its structure. \nBenzene was found to be a stable molecule \nand found to form a triozonide which indicates \nthe presence of three double bonds. Benzene \nwas further found to produce one and only one \nmonosubstituted derivative which indicated \nthat all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms \nof benzene are identical. On the basis of this \nobservation August Kekul\u00e9 in 1865 proposed \nthe following structure for benzene having \ncyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with \nalternate single and double bonds and one \nhydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom.\n \n The Kekul\u00e9  structure indicates  \nthe possibility of two isomeric   \n1, 2-dibromobenzenes.

The Lewis \nstructure or dot structure, dash structure, \ncondensed structure and bond line structural \nformulas are some of the specific types. The \nLewis structures, however, can be simplified \nby representing the two-electron covalent \nbond by a dash (\u2013). Such a structural formula \nfocuses on the electrons involved in bond \nformation.  A single dash represents a single \nbond, double dash  is used for double bond \nand a triple dash represents triple bond. Lone-\npairs of electrons on heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, \nnitrogen, sulphur, halogens etc.) may or may \nnot be shown. Thus, ethane (C\n2H6), ethene \n(C2H4), ethyne (C2H2) and methanol (CH3OH) \ncan be represented by the following structural \nformulas. Such structural representations are \ncalled complete structural formulas.\nSimilarly, CH\n3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 \ncan be further condensed to CH 3(CH2)6CH3. \nFor further simplification, organic chemists \nuse another way of representing the \nstructures, in which only lines are used. \nIn this bond-line structural representation \nof organic compounds, carbon and \nhydrogen atoms are not shown and the \nlines representing carbon-carbon bonds are  \ndrawn in a zig-zag fashion.

Some \nof the condensing liquid in the fractionating \ncolumn obtains heat from the ascending \nvapours and revaporises.  The vapours thus \nbecome richer in low boiling component.  The \nvapours of low boiling component ascend \nto the top of the column. On reaching the \ntop, the vapours become pure in low boiling \ncomponent and pass through the condenser \nand the pure liquid is collected in a receiver.  \nAfter a series of successive distillations, the \nremaining liquid in the distillation flask gets \nenriched in high boiling component.

A liquid boils at a temperature below its \nvapour pressure by reducing the pressure.\nSteam Distillation: This technique is \napplied to separate substances which are \nsteam volatile and are immiscible with water. \nIn steam distillation, steam from a steam \ngenerator is passed through a heated flask \ncontaining the liquid to be distilled. The \nmixture of steam and the volatile organic \ncompound is condensed and collected. The \ncompound is later separated from water using \na separating funnel. In steam distillation, \nthe liquid boils when the sum of vapour \npressures due to the organic liquid (p\n1) \nand that due to water (p 2) becomes equal to \nthe atmospheric pressure (p), i.e. p =p 1+ p2. \nSince p1 is lower than p, the organic liquid \nvaporises at lower temperature than its \nboiling point. \nThus, if one of the substances in the \nmixture is water and the other, a water \ninsoluble substance, then the mixture will boil \nclose to but below, 373K.

The nature of the covalent bonding \nin organic compounds can be described in terms of orbitals hybridisation concept, \naccording to which carbon can have sp\n3, sp2 and sp hybridised orbitals. The sp3, sp2 and sp \nhybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethene and ethyne respectively. \nThe tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can \nbe understood on the basis of this concept. A sp\n3 hybrid orbital can overlap with 1s orbital \nof hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen (C\u2013H) single bond (sigma, \u03c3 bond). Overlap of a sp2 \norbital of one carbon with sp2 orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon\u2013carbon \n\u03c3 bond. The unhybridised p orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo lateral (side-\nby-side) overlap to give a pi (\u03c0) bond. Organic compounds can be represented by various \nstructural formulas. The three dimensional representation of organic compounds on paper \ncan be drawn by wedge and dash formula.\nOrganic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional \ngroups they contain.

In IUPAC nomenclatur\ne, \nthe names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the \nstructure from the name.\nOrganic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate \nmolecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects \nand the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making \nof covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in heterolytic or homolytic fashion. \nA heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives \nfree radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage \ninvolve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as \nnucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance, \nelectromeric and hyperconjugation effects may help in the polarisation of a bond making \ncertain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities.\nOrganic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition, \nelimination and rearrangement reactions.",

Partition chromatography involves continuous partitioning of the \ncomponents of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. After getting the compound \nin a pure form, its qualitative analysis is carried out for detection of elements present in it. \nNitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus are detected by \nlassaigne\u2019s test\n. Carbon and \nhydrogen are estimated by determining the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced. \nNitrogen is estimated by \ndumas or \nKjeldahl\u2019s method and halogens by Carius method. \nSulphur and phosphorus are estimated by oxidising them to sulphuric and phosphoric acids \nrespectively. The percentage of oxygen is usually determined by difference between the total \npercentage (100) and the sum of percentages of all other elements present.",

About 20 monosaccharides are known to occur in\nnature.

These are\nwater-soluble, high melting solids and behave like salts rather than\nsimple amines or carboxylic acids. This behaviour is due to the presence\nof both acidic (carboxyl group) and basic (amino\ngroup) groups in the same molecule. In aqueous\nsolution, the carboxyl group can lose a proton\nand amino group can accept a proton, giving rise\nto a dipolar ion known as zwitter ion . This is\nneutral but contains both positive and negative\ncharges.\nIn zwitter ionic form, amino acids show amphoteric behaviour as\nthey react both with acids and bases.\nExcept glycine, all other naturally occurring a-amino acids are\noptically active, since the a-carbon atom is asymmetric. These exist\nboth in \u2018D\u2019 and \u2018L\u2019 forms. Most naturally occurring amino acids have\nL-configuration. L-Aminoacids are represented by writing the \u2013NH2 group\non left hand side.\nYou have already read that proteins are the polymers of a-amino acids\nand they are connected to each other by peptide bond  or peptide\nlinkage. Chemically, peptide linkage is an amide formed between\n\u2013COOH group and \u2013NH 2 group. The reaction between two molecules of\nsimilar or different amino acids, proceeds through\nthe combination of the amino group of one molecule\nwith the carboxyl group of the other.

For example, when carboxyl group of\nglycine combines with the amino group of alanine\nwe get a dipeptide, glycylalanine.\nIf a third amino acid combines to a dipeptide, the product is called a\ntripeptide. A tripeptide contains three amino acids linked by two peptide\nlinkages. Similarly when four, five or six amino acids are linked, the respective\nproducts are known as tetrapeptide, pentapeptide or hexapeptide,\nrespectively. When the number of such amino acids is more than ten, then\nthe products are called polypeptides. A polypeptide with more than hundred\namino acid residues, having molecular mass higher than 10,000u is called\na protein. However, the distinction between a polypeptide and a protein is\nnot very sharp. Polypeptides with fewer amino acids are likely to be called\nproteins if they ordinarily have a well defined conformation of a protein such\nas insulin which contains 51 amino acids.\nProteins can be classified into two types on the basis of their\nmolecular shape.\n(a) Fibrous proteins\nWhen the polypeptide chains run parallel and are held together by\nhydrogen and disulphide bonds, then fibre\u2013  like structure is formed.

Besides inductive effect, there are other effects like\nsolvation effect, steric hinderance, etc., which affect the basic strength\nof amines. Just ponder over. You may get the answer in the following\nparagraphs.\nStructure-basicity relationship of amines\nBasicity of amines is related to their structure.  Basic character of\nan amine depends upon the ease of formation of the cation by\naccepting a proton from the acid.  The more stable the cation is\nrelative to the amine, more basic is the amine.\n(a) Alkanamines versus ammonia\nLet us consider the reaction of an alkanamine and ammonia with\na proton to compare their basicity.\nDue to the electron releasing nature of alkyl group, it pushes\nelectrons towards nitrogen and thus makes the unshared electron\npair more available for sharing with the proton of the acid. Moreover,\nthe substituted ammonium ion formed from the amine gets stabilised\ndue to dispersal of the positive charge by the +I effect of the alkyl\ngroup.  Hence, alkylamines are stronger bases than ammonia.\nThus, the basic nature of aliphatic amines should increase with\nincrease in the number of alkyl groups. This trend is followed in\nthe gaseous phase. The order of basicity of amines in the gaseous\nphase follows the expected order: tertiary amine > secondary amine",

Secondly, when the\nalkyl group is small, like \u2013CH 3 group, there is no steric hindrance to\nH-bonding.

Therefore,  the change of nature of\nthe alkyl group, e.g., from \u2013CH3 to \u2013C 2H5 results in change of the order\nof basic strength. Thus, there is a subtle interplay of the inductive\neffect, solvation effect and steric hinderance of the alkyl group which\ndecides the basic strength of alkyl amines in the aqueous state.  The\norder of basic strength in case of methyl substituted amines and ethyl\nsubstituted amines in aqueous solution is as follows:\n(C2H5)2NH > (C2H5)3N > C2H5NH2 > NH3\n(CH3)2NH > CH3NH2 > (CH3)3N > NH3\n(b) Arylamines versus ammonia\npKb value of aniline is quite high.

That is why besides the\northo and para derivatives, significant amount of meta derivative\nis also formed.\nHowever, by pr otecting the \u2013NH 2 group by acetylation r eaction\nwith acetic anhydride, the nitration  reaction can be controlled\nand the p-nitro derivative can be obtained as the major product.\n(c) Sulphonation:  Aniline reacts with concentrated sulphuric acid\nto form anilinium hydrogensulphate which on heating with\nsulphuric acid at 453-473K produces p-aminobenzene sulphonic\nacid, commonly known as sulphanilic acid, as the major product.\nAniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction (alkylation and\nacetylation) due to salt formation with aluminium chloride, the\nLewis acid, which is used as a catalyst. Due to this, nitrogen of\naniline acquires positive charge and hence acts as a strong\ndeactivating group for further reaction.\nReprint 2025-26",

DIAZONIUM SALTS\nThe diazonium salts have the general formula \n\u2013\n2R N X\n\uf02b\n where R stands\nfor an aryl group and \n\u2013\nX  ion may be Cl\n\u2013\n Br,\n\u2013 \n4HSO\uf02d , 4BF\uf02d , etc. They are\nnamed by suffixing diazonium to the name of the parent hydrocarbon\nfrom which they are formed, followed by the name of anion such as\nchloride, hydrogensulphate, etc. The 2N\n\uf02b\n group is called diazonium\ngroup.

The stability of arenediazonium ion is explained on the\nbasis  of resonance.\nBenzenediazonium chloride is prepared by the reaction of aniline with\nnitrous acid at 273-278K. Nitrous acid is produced in the reaction\nmixture by the reaction of sodium nitrite with hydrochloric acid. The\nconversion of primary aromatic amines into diazonium salts is known\nas diazotisation.

Benzenediazonium\nfluoroborate is water insoluble and stable at room temperature.\nThe reactions of diazonium salts can be broadly divided into two\ncategories, namely (A) reactions involving displacement of nitrogen and\n(B) reactions involving retention of diazo group.\nA. Reactions involving displacement of nitrogen\nDiazonium group being a very good leaving group, is substituted\nby other groups such as Cl\n\u2013\n, Br\n\u2013\n, I\n\u2013\n, CN\n\u2013\n and OH\n\u2013\n which displace\nnitrogen from the aromatic ring.

This principle marks\na departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our\nsystem and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi\nand textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement\nthis basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance\nof sharp boundaries between different subject areas. W\ne hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of\neducation outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to\npursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space,\ntime and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the\ninformation passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as\nthe sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and\nsites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we\nperceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed\nbody of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of",

In this backgr ound, the NCER T has undertaken the exer cise to\nrationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed\nby the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n\u2022 Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same\nclass\n\u2022 Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n\u2022 Difficulty level\n\u2022 Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions\nfrom teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-\nlearning\n\u2022 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the\nchanges given above.\nReprint 2025-26",

The rate of advancements in chemistry is so\nhigh that curriculum developers continuously look for strategies to cope with\nthese advancements. Also, the students have to be inspired to be the future\nleaders who would make fundamental contributions. The present textbook is\na sincere effort in this direction.\nThe textbook, presented in two parts, comprises of sixteen Units. Although\nthe titles of various Units indicate a sort of compartmentalisation into physical,\ninorganic and organic chemistry, readers will find that these sub-disciplines\nhave been intermingled, at least to a certain extent, to have a unified approach\nto the subject. First nine Units covering physical and inorganic chemistry\nportions are included in Part I while organic chemistry portion comprising of\nseven Units is included in Part II of the book. The approach of presentation\nof the subject matter discourages students from rote memorisation. The subject\nhas in fact, been organised around the laws and principles of chemistry. As\nstudents master these laws and principles, they will soon get to the point\nwhere they can predict much of what will come.\nEfforts have been directed towards making the subject stimulating and exciting\nby references to the historical developments and its usefulness to our lives,\nwherever appropriate.

Answers of some of these exercises\nare given at the end of the book.\nA variety of materials, e.g., biographical sketches of some scientists, additional\ninformation related to a particular topic, etc., is given in boxes with a deep\nyellow coloured bar. This boxed material with a 'deep yellow bar' is to bring\nadditional life to the topic. However , it is  non-evaluative.

However, it is necessary for students to\nbe aware of commercially important chemicals, their processes of manufacture\nand sources of raw materials.

Thermodynamics, kinetics and\nelectrochemical aspects have been applied to a few chemical reactions which\nshould be beneficial to students for understanding why a particular reaction\nhappened and why a particular property is exhibited by the product.

For example, equilibria \ninvolving O\n2 molecules and the protein hemoglobin play \na crucial role in the transport and delivery of O 2 from \nour lungs to our muscles. Similar equilibria involving CO \nmolecules and hemoglobin account for the toxicity of CO.\nWhen a liquid evaporates in a closed container, \nmolecules with relatively higher kinetic energy escape \nthe liquid surface into the vapour phase and number of \nliquid molecules from the vapour phase strike the liquid \nsurface and are retained in the liquid phase. It gives rise \nto a constant vapour pressure because of an equilibrium in \nwhich the number of molecules leaving the liquid equals the \nnumber returning to liquid from the vapour. We say that \nthe system has reached equilibrium state at this stage. \nHowever, this is not static equilibrium and there is a lot of \nactivity at the boundary between the liquid and the vapour. \nThus, at equilibrium, the rate of evaporation is equal to the \nrate of condensation. It may be represented by\nH\n2O (l)   H2O (vap)\nThe double half arrows indicate that the processes \nin both the directions are going on simultaneously. The \nmixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state \nis called an equilibrium mixture.\nEquilibrium can be established for both physical \nprocesses and chemical reactions.

In \na saturated solution, a dynamic equilibrium \nexits between the solute molecules in the solid \nstate and in the solution:\nSugar (solution) \n Sugar (solid), and \nthe rate of dissolution of sugar = rate of \ncrystallisation of sugar.\nEquality of the two rates and dynamic \nnature of equilibrium has been confirmed with \nthe help of radioactive sugar. If we drop some \nradioactive sugar into saturated solution of \nnon-radioactive sugar, then after some time \nradioactivity is observed both in the solution \nand in the solid sugar. Initially there were no \nradioactive sugar molecules in the solution \nbut due to dynamic nature of equilibrium, \nthere is exchange between the radioactive \nand non-radioactive sugar molecules between \nthe two phases. The ratio of the radioactive \nto non-radioactive molecules in the solution \nincreases till it attains a constant value.\nGases in liquids",

Strong acids like perchloric acid \n(HClO\n4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic \nacid (HBr), hyrdoiodic acid (HI), nitric acid \n(HNO\n3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) are termed \nstrong because they are almost completely \ndissociated into their constituent ions in an \naqueous medium, thereby acting as proton \n(H\n+) donors.

The carbon\u2013 oxygen bond\nlength (136 pm) in phenol is slightly less than that in methanol.

This can be\nillustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide.\nThis reaction shows that water is a better proton donor (i.e.,\nstronger acid) than alcohol. Also, in the above reaction, we note\nthat an alkoxide ion is a better proton acceptor than hydroxide\nion, which suggests that alkoxides are stronger bases (sodium\nethoxide is a stronger base than sodium hydroxide).\nAlcohols act as Bronsted bases as well. It is due to the\npresence of unshared electron pairs on oxygen, which makes\nthem proton acceptors.\n(iii) Acidity of phenols:  The reactions of phenol with metals (e.g.,\nsodium, aluminium) and sodium hydroxide indicate its acidic\nnature. The hydroxyl group, in phenol is directly attached to\nthe sp\n2\n hybridised carbon of benzene ring which acts as an\nelectron withdrawing group.

It attacks the least substituted carbon of the oxonium\nion formed in step 1 and displaces an alcohol molecule by S N2\n \nmechanism.\nThus, in the cleavage of mixed ethers with two different alkyl groups, the alcohol\nand alkyl iodide formed, depend on the nature of alkyl groups. When primary or\nsecondary alkyl groups are present, it is the lower alkyl group that forms alkyl\niodide (S N2 reaction).\nWhen HI is in excess and the reaction is carried out at high temperature,\nethanol reacts with another molecule of HI and is converted to ethyl iodide.\nStep 3:\nMechanism MechanismMechanismMechanismMechanism\nHowever, when one of the alkyl group is a tertiary group, the halide\nformed is a tertiary halide.\nCH C CH + HI CH OH +CH C I3 3 3 3\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nO\nIt is because in step 2 of the reaction, the departure of leaving group\n(HO\u2013CH3) creates a more stable carbocation [(CH3)3C\n+\n], and the reaction\nfollows SN1 mechanism.\nIn case of anisole, methylphenyl\noxonium ion,  is\nformed by protonation of ether.

They add fragrance and flavour to nature, for example,\nvanillin (from vanilla beans), salicylaldehyde (from meadow sweet) and\ncinnamaldehyde (from cinnamon) have very pleasant fragrances.\n8.1.1\nNomenclature\nI. Aldehydes and ketones\nAldehydes and ketones are the simplest and most important carbonyl\ncompounds.\nThere are two systems of nomenclature of aldehydes and ketones.\n(a) Common names\nAldehydes and ketones are often called by their common names\ninstead of IUPAC names. The common names of most aldehydes are\nderived from the common names of the corresponding carboxylic\nacids [Section 8.6.1] by replacing the ending \u2013ic of acid with aldehyde.\nAt the same time, the names reflect the Latin or Greek term for the\noriginal source of the acid or aldehyde. The location of the substituent\nin the carbon chain is indicated by Greek letters a, b, g,\n d, etc. The\na-carbon being the one directly linked to the aldehyde group,  b-\ncarbon the next, and so on.

In case of\naldehydes the longest carbon chain is numbered starting from the\ncarbon of the aldehyde group while in case of ketones the\nnumbering begins from the end nearer to the carbonyl group. The\nsubstituents are prefixed in alphabetical order along with numerals\nindicating their positions in the carbon chain. The same applies to\ncyclic ketones, where the carbonyl carbon is numbered one. When\nthe aldehyde group is attached to a ring, the suffix carbaldehyde\nis added after the full name of the cycloalkane.

The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system\nof education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\nrecognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning.

In this background, the NCERT has\nundertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes.\nLearning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes\nhave been taken into consideration in this exercise.\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n\u2022 Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in\nthe same class\n\u2022 Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same\nsubject\n\u2022 Difficulty level\n\u2022 Content, which is easily accessible to students without much\ninterventions from teachers and can be learned by children through\nself-learning or peer-learning\n\u2022 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the\nchanges given above.\nReprint 2025-26",

The rate of advancements in chemistry is so\nhigh that curriculum developers continuously look for strategies to cope with\nthese advancements. Also, the students have to be inspired to be the future\nleaders who would make fundamental contributions. The present textbook is\na sincere effort in this direction.\nThe structure of the textbook, presented in two parts, comprises of sixteen\nUnits. Although the titles of various Units indicate a sort of\ncompartmentalisation into physical, inorganic and organic chemistry, readers\nwill find that these sub-disciplines have been intermingled, at least to a certain\nextent, to have a unified approach to the subject.  The approach of presentation\nof the subject matter discourages students from rote memorisation. The subject\nhas in fact, been organised around the laws and principles of chemistry. As\nstudents master these laws and principles, they will soon get to the point\nwhere they can predict much of what will come.\nEfforts have been directed towards making the subject stimulating and\nexciting by references to the historical developments and its usefulness to our\nlives, wherever appropriate. The text is well illustrated with examples from\nsurrounding environment to facilitate grasping of the qualitative and\nquantitative aspects of the concept easily. Physical data are given in SI units",

The surroundings include \neverything other than the system. System \nand the surroundings together constitute the \nuniverse. \nThe universe = The system + The surroundings\nHowever, the entire universe other than \nthe system is not affected by the changes \ntaking place in the system. Therefore, for all \npractical purposes, the surroundings are that \nportion of the remaining universe which can \ninteract with the system. Usually, the region \nof space in the neighbourhood of the system \nconstitutes its surroundings.\nFor example, if we are studying the \nreaction between two substances A and B \nkept in a beaker, the beaker containing the \nreaction mixture is the system and the room \nwhere the beaker is kept is the surroundings \n(Fig. 5.1). \nFig. 5.1 System and the surroundings\nthe system from the surroundings is called \nboundary.

For a spontan\neous change, total entropy change is positive. \nTherefore, for an isolated system, \u2206U = 0, \u2206S > 0, so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous \nchange, while energy change does not.

For \nexample, 0.200 g has three significant \nfigures. But, if otherwise, the terminal \nzeros are not significant if there is no \ndecimal point. For example, 100 has \nonly one significant figure, but 100 has \nthree significant figures and 100.0 has \nfour significant figures. Such numbers \nare better represented in scientific \nnotation.

This is known as 1 mol of the \nrespective particles or entities.\nChemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and \ncompounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients \nindicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular \nreaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called \nstoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or more reactant(s) \nrequired to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The \namount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways, \ne.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.\nexerci\nSeS\n1.1 Calculate the molar mass of the following:\n (i) H2O  (ii)  CO2 (iii) CH4",

In order to dissolve\nhaloalkane in water, energy is required to overcome the attractions between\nthe haloalkane molecules and break the hydrogen bonds between water\nmolecules. Less energy is released when new attractions are set up between\nthe haloalkane and the water molecules as these are not as strong as the\noriginal hydrogen bonds in water. As a result, the solubility of haloalkanes\nin water is low.

A substitution reaction takes place and halogen atom,\ncalled leaving group departs as halide ion. Since the substitution\nreaction is initiated by a nucleophile, it is called nucleophilic\nsubstitution reaction.\nIt is one of the most useful classes of organic reactions of alkyl\nhalides in which halogen is bonded to sp3 hybridised carbon.

While attempting to find an efficient catalyst for the process\nof methylation, he noted that Zn in diethyl ether had been used for this\npurpose and wondered whether the Mg/ether combination might be\nsuccessful. Grignard reagents were first reported in 1900 and Grignard\nused this work for his doctoral thesis in 1901.

Through inductive effect, chlorine\ndestabilises the intermediate carbocation formed during the electrophilic\nsubstitution.\nThrough resonance, halogen tends to stabilise the carbocation and\nthe effect is more pronounced at ortho- and para\n- positions. The\ninductive effect is stronger than resonance and causes net electron\nwithdrawal and thus causes net deactivation.

Direct contact with the eyes can burn the cornea.\nChemically, chloroform is employed as a solvent for fats, alkaloids,\niodine and other substances. The major use of chloroform today is in\nthe production of the freon refrigerant R-22. It was once used as a\ngeneral anaesthetic in surgery but has been replaced by less toxic,\nsafer anaesthetics, such as ether.
