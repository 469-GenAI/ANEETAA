Now a\nquestion that arises in our minds is: Are all living organisms made of the\nsame chemicals, i.e., elements and compounds? Y ou have lear nt in\nchemistry how elemental analysis is performed. If we perform such an\nanalysis on a plant tissue, animal tissue or a microbial paste, we obtain a\nlist of elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and several others and\ntheir respective content per unit mass of a living tissue. If the same analysis\nis performed on a piece of earth\u2019s crust as an example of non-living matter,\nwe obtain a similar list. What are the differences between the two lists? In\nabsolute terms, no such differences could be made out. All the elements\npresent in a sample of earth\u2019s crust are also present in a sample of living\ntissue. However, a closer examination reveals that the relative abundance\nof carbon and hydrogen with respect to other elements is higher in any\nliving organism than in earth\u2019s crust (Table 9.1).\n9.1 HOW TO ANALYSE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION?\nWe can continue asking in the same way, what type of organic compounds\nare found in living organisms? How does one go about finding the answer?\nTo get an answer, one has to perform a chemical analysis. We can take any\nliving tissue (a vegetable or a piece of liver, etc.) and grind it in trichloroacetic\nacid (Cl3CCOOH) using a mortar and a pestle. We obtain a thick slurry. If",

Of course,\nonly some portions of the protein\nthread are arranged in the form of a\nhelix. In proteins, only right handed\nhelices are observed. Other regions\nof the protein thread are folded into\nother forms in what is called the\nsecondary structure  (Fig. 9.3 b). In\naddition, the long protein chain is\nalso folded upon itself like a hollow\nwoolen ball, giving rise to the\ntertiary structure  (Fig. 9.3 c). This\ngives us a 3-dimensional view of a\nprotein.

One such pocket is the \u2018active site\u2019. An active site of an\nenzyme is a crevice or pocket into which the substrate fits. Thus enzymes,\nthrough their active site, catalyse reactions at a high rate. Enzyme catalysts\ndiffer from inorganic catalysts in many ways, but one major difference\nneeds mention. Inorganic catalysts work efficiently at high temperatures\nand high pressures, while enzymes get damaged at high temperatures\n(say above 40\u00b0C). However, enzymes isolated from organisms who normally\nlive under extremely high temperatures (e.g., hot vents and sulphur\nsprings), are stable and retain their catalytic power even at high\ntemperatures (upto 80\u00b0-90\u00b0C). Thermal stability is thus an important\nquality of such enzymes isolated from thermophilic organisms.\n9.8.1 Chemical Reactions\nHow do we understand these enzymes? Let us first understand a chemical\nreaction. Chemical compounds undergo two types of changes. A physical\nchange simply refers to a change in shape without breaking of bonds.\nThis is a physical process. Another physical process is a change in state\nof matter: when ice melts into water, or when water becomes a vapour.\nThese are also physical processes. However, when bonds are broken and\nnew bonds are formed during transformation, this will be called a chemical\nreaction. For example:\nBa(OH)2 + H2SO4 \n\u2192  BaSO4 + 2H2O",

We have already\nunderstood the idea of an \u2018active site\u2019. The chemical or metabolic conversion\nrefers to a reaction. The chemical which is converted into a product is\ncalled a \u2018substrate\u2019. Hence enzymes, i.e. proteins with three dimensional\nstructures including an \u2018active site\u2019, convert a substrate (S) into a product\n(P). Symbolically, this can be depicted as:\nS \n\u2192 P\nIt is now understood that the substrate \u2018S\u2019 has to bind the enzyme at\nits \u2018active site\u2019 within a given cleft or pocket. The substrate has to diffuse\ntowards the \u2018active site\u2019. There is thus, an obligatory formation of an \u2018ES\u2019\ncomplex. E stands for enzyme. This complex formation is a transient\nphenomenon. During the state where substrate is bound to the enzyme\nactive site, a new structure of the substrate called transition state structure\nis formed. V ery so on, after the expected bond breaking/making is\ncompleted, the product is released from the active site. In other words,\nthe structure of substrate gets transformed into the structure of product(s).\nThe pathway of this transformation must go through the so-called\nReprint 2025-26",

Low\ntemperature preserves the enzyme in a temporarily inactive state whereas\nhigh temperature destroys enzymatic activity because proteins are\ndenatured by heat.\nConcentration of Substrate\nWith the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of the enzymatic\nreaction rises at first. The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity\n(Vmax) which is not exceeded by any further rise in concentration of the\nsubstrate. This is because the enzyme molecules are fewer than the\nsubstrate molecules and after saturation of these molecules, there are no\nfree enzyme molecules to bind with the additional substrate molecules\n(Figure 9.5).\nThe activity of an enzyme is also sensitive to the presence of specific",

The\nelemental composition of living tissues and non-living matter appear also to be\nsimilar when analysed qualitatively. However, a closer examination reveals that\nthe relative abundance of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen is higher in living systems\nwhen compared to inanimate matter . The most abundant chemical in living\norganisms is water. There are thousands of small molecular weight (<1000 Da)\nbiomolecules. Amino acids, monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars, fatty acids,\nglycerol, nucleotides, nucleosides and nitrogen bases are some of the organic\ncompounds seen in living organisms. There are 20 types of amino acids and 5\ntypes of nucleotides. Fats and oils are glycerides in which fatty acids are esterified\nto glycerol. Phospholipids contain, in addition, a phosphorylated nitrogenous\ncompound.\nOnly three types of macromolecules , i.e., proteins, nucleic acids and\npolysaccharides are found in living systems. Lipids, because of their association\nwith membranes separate in the macromolecular fraction. Biomacromolecules\nare polymers. They are made of building blocks which are different. Proteins\nare heteropolymers made of amino acids. Nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are\ncomposed of nucleotides. Biomacromolecules have a hierarchy of structures  \u2013\nReprint 2025-26",

Protonephridia or flame cells are\nthe excretory structures in Platyhelminthes (Flatworms, e.g., Planaria),\nrotifers, some annelids and the cephalochordate \u2013 Amphioxus .\nProtonephridia are primarily concerned with ionic and fluid volume\nregulation, i.e., osmoregulation. Nephridia are the tubular excretory\nstructures of earthworms and other annelids. Nephridia help to remove\nnitrogenous wastes and maintain a fluid and ionic balance. Malpighian\ntubules are the excretory structures of most of the insects including\ncockroaches. Malpighian tubules help in the removal of nitrogenous\nwastes and osmoregulation.

GFR in a healthy individual is\napproximately 125 ml/minute, i.e., 180 litres per day !\nThe kidneys have built-in mechanisms for the regulation of glomerular\nfiltration rate. One such efficient mechanism is carried out by juxta\nglomerular apparatus (JGA). JGA is a special sensitive region formed by\ncellular modifications in the distal convoluted tubule and the afferent\narteriole at the location of their contact. A fall in GFR can activate the JG\ncells to release renin which can stimulate the glomerular blood flow and\nthereby the GFR back to normal.\nA comparison of the volume of the filtrate formed per day (180 litres\nper day) with that of the urine released (1.5 litres), suggest that nearly 99\nper cent of the filtrate has to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This\nprocess is called reabsorption. The tubular epithelial cells in different\nsegments of nephron perform this either by active or passive mechanisms.\nFor example, substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+, etc., in the filtrate\nare reabsorbed actively whereas the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by\npassive transport.

Similarly, small amounts of urea\nenter the thin segment of the ascending limb of Henle\u2019s loop which is\ntransported back to the interstitium by the collecting tubule. The above\ndescribed transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangement\nof Henle\u2019s loop and vasa recta is called the counter current mechanism\n(Figure. 16.6).

Presence of such interstitial gradient helps\nin an easy passage of water from the collecting tubule thereby\nconcentrating the filtrate (urine). Human kidneys can produce urine nearly\nfour times concentrated than the initial filtrate formed.\n16.5 REGULATION  OF KIDNEY FUNCTION\nThe functioning of the kidneys is efficiently monitored and regulated by\nhormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, JGA and\nto a certain extent, the heart.\nOsmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume,\nbody fluid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of fluid from\nthe body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamus\nto release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin  from the\nneurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts of\nthe tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body fluid volume\ncan switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to complete\nthe feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictory\neffects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. An\nincrease in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood flow and\nthereby the GFR.\nThe JGA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular blood\nflow/glomerular blood pressure/GFR can activate the JG cells to release\nrenin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and\nfurther to angiotensin II.

Nature of nitrogenous wastes formed and their\nexcretion vary among animals, mainly depending on the habitat (availability of\nwater). Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major nitrogenous wastes excreted.\nProtonephridia, nephridia, malpighian tubules, green glands and the kidneys are\nthe common excretory organs in animals. They not only eliminate nitrogenous wastes\nbut also help in the maintenance of ionic and acid-base balance of body fluids.\nIn humans, the excretory system consists of one pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters,\na urinary bladder and a urethra. Each kidney has over a million tubular structures\ncalled nephrons. Nephron is the functional unit of kidney and has two portions \u2013\nglomerulus and renal tubule. Glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed from afferent\narterioles, fine branches of renal artery. The renal tubule starts with a double walled\nBowman\u2019s capsule and is further differentiated into a proximal convoluted tubule\n(PCT), Henle\u2019s loop (HL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCTs of many\nnephrons join to a common collecting duct many of which ultimately open into the\nrenal pelvis through the medullary pyramids.

Streaming of protoplasm in\nthe unicellular organisms like Amoeba is a simple form of movement.\nMovement of cilia, flagella and tentacles are shown by many organisms.\nHuman beings can move limbs, jaws, eyelids, tongue, etc. Some of the\nmovements result in a change of place or location. Such voluntary\nmovements are called locomotion. Walking, running, climbing, flying\nand swimming are all some forms of locomotory movements. Locomotory\nstructures need not be different from those affecting other types of\nmovements. For example, in Paramoecium, cilia helps in the movement of\nfood through cytopharynx and in locomotion as well. Hydra can use its\ntentacles for capturing its prey and also use them for locomotion. We use\nlimbs for changes in body postures and locomotion as well. The above\nobservations suggest that movements and locomotion cannot be studied\nseparately. The two may be linked by stating that all locomotions are\nmovements but all movements are not locomotions.\nMethods of locomotion performed by animals vary with their habitats\nand the demand of the situation. However, locomotion is generally for\nsearch of fo od, shelter, mate, suitable bre eding grounds, favourable\nclimatic conditions or to escape from enemies/predators.\n17.1 TYPES OF MOVEMENT\nCells of the human body exhibit three main types of movements, namely,",

The junction between a\nmotor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre is called the\nneuromuscular junction or motor-end plate.

The number of cervical\nvertebrae are seven in almost all mammals\nincluding human beings. The vertebral column\nprotects the spinal cord, supports the head and\nserves as the point of attachment for the ribs\nand musculature of the back. Sternum is a\nflat bone on the ventral midline of thorax.\nThere are 12 pairs of ribs. Each rib is a\nthin flat bone connected dorsally to the\nvertebral column and ventrally to the sternum.\nIt has two articulation surfaces on its dorsal\nend and is hence called bicephalic.

Force generated by the muscles is used to carry out movement\nthrough joints, where the joint acts as a fulcrum. The movability at these\njoints vary depending on different factors. Joints have been classified into\nthree major structural forms, namely, fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial.\nFibrous joints do not allow any movement. This type of joint is shown\nby the flat skull bones which fuse end-to-end with the help of dense fibrous\nconnective tissues in the form of sutures, to form the cranium.\nIn cartilaginous joints, the bones involved are joined together with\nthe help of cartilages. The joint between the adjacent vertebrae in the\nvertebral column is of this pattern and it permits limited movements.\nSynovial joints are characterised by the presence of a fluid filled synovial\ncavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. Such an arragement\nallows considerable movement. These joints help in locomotion and many\nother movements. Ball and socket joint (between humerus and pectoral\ngirdle), hinge joint (knee joint), pivot joint (between atlas and axis), gliding\njoint (between the carpals) and saddle joint (between carpal and metacarpal\nof thumb) are some examples.\n17.5 DISORDERS OF MUSCULAR  AND SKELETAL SYSTEM\nMyasthenia gravis:  Auto immune disorder affecting neuromuscular\njunction leading to fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscle.",

Animals move generally in search of food, shelter, mate, breeding\nground, better climate or to protect themselves.\nThe cells of the human body exhibit amoeboid, ciliary and muscular\nmovements. Locomotion and many other movements require coordinated muscular\nactivities. Three types of muscles are present in our body. Skeletal muscles are\nattached to skeletal elements. They appear striated and are voluntary in nature.\nVisceral muscles, present in the inner walls of visceral organs are nonstriated and\ninvoluntary. Cardiac muscles are the muscles of the heart. They are striated,\nbranched and involuntary. Muscles possess excitability, contractility, extensibility\nand elasticity.\nMuscle fibre is the anatomical unit of muscle. Each muscle fibre has many\nparallelly arranged myofibrils. Each myofibril contains many serially arranged\nunits called sarcomere which are the functional units. Each sarcomere has a central\n\u2018A\u2019 band made of thick myosin filaments, and two half \u2018I\u2019 bands made of thin actin\nfilaments on either side of it marked by \u2018Z\u2019  lines. Actin and myosin are polymerised\nproteins with contractility. The active sites for myosin on resting actin filament are\nmasked by a protein-troponin.

Such an alarming growth rate could lead to an\nabsolute scarcity of even the basic requirements, i.e., food, shelter and\nclothing, in spite of significant progress made in those areas. Therefore,\nthe government was forced to take up serious measures to check this\npopulation growth rate.\nThe most important step to overcome this problem is to motivate smaller\nfamilies by using various contraceptive methods. You might have seen\nadvertisements in the media as well as posters/bills, etc., showing a happy\ncouple with two children with a slogan Hum Do Hamare Do (we two, our\ntwo). Many couples, mostly the young, urban, working ones have even\nadopted an \u2018one child norm\u2019. Statutory raising of marriageable age of the\nfemale to 18 years and that of males to 21 years, and incentives given to\ncouples with small families are two of the other measures taken to tackle\nthis problem. Let us describe some of the commonly used contraceptive\nmethods, which help prevent unwanted pregnancies.\nAn ideal contraceptive should be user -friendly, easily available,\neffective and reversible with no or least side-effects.

Periodic abstinence is one such method in which\nthe couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of the menstrual\ncycle when ovulation could be expected. As chances of fertilisation are\nvery high during this period, it is called the fertile period. Therefore, by\nabstaining from coitus during this period, conception could\nbe prevented. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus is another\nmethod in which the male partner withdraws his penis from\nthe vagina just before ejaculation so as to avoid\ninsemination. Lactational amenorrhea (absence of\nmenstruation) method is based on the fact that ovulation\nand therefore the cycle do not occur during the period of\nintense lactation following parturition. Therefore, as long\nas the mother breast-feeds the child fully, chances of\nconception are almost nil. However, this method has been\nreported to be effective only upto a maximum period of six\nmonths following parturition. As no medicines or devices\nare used in these methods, side effects are almost nil.\nChances of failure, though, of this method are also high.\nIn \nbarrier methods, ovum and sperms are prevented\nfrom physically meeting with the help of barriers.

The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit of\nlife \u2013 the cell in all living organisms.\nAll organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a single\ncell and are called unicellular organisms while others, like us, composed\nof many cells, are called multicellular organisms.\n8.1 WHAT IS A CELL?\nUnicellular organisms are capable of (i) independent existence and\n(ii) performing the essential functions of life. Anything less than a complete\nstructure of a cell does not ensure independent living. Hence, cell is the\nfundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms.\nAntonie Von Leeuwenhoek first saw and described a live cell. Robert\nBrown later discovered the nucleus.

He also concluded, based on his studies on\nplant tissues, that the presence of cell wall is a unique character of\nthe plant cells. On the basis of this, Schwann proposed the hypothesis\nthat the bodies of animals and plants are composed of cells and\nproducts of cells.\nSchleiden and Schwann together formulated the cell theory . This\ntheory however, did not explain as to how new cells were formed. Rudolf\nVirchow (1855) first explained that cells divided and new cells are formed\nfrom pre-existing cells ( Omnis cellula-e cellula). H e modified the\nhypothesis of Schleiden and Schwann to give the cell theory a final\nshape. Cell theory as understood today is:\n(i) all living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells.\n(ii) all cells arise from pre-existing cells.\n8.3 AN OVERVIEW OF CELL\nYou have earlier observed cells in an onion peel and/or human cheek\ncells under the microscope.

Meanwhile, chemical studies on\nthe cell membrane, especially in human red blood cells (RBCs), enabled\nthe scientists to deduce the possible structure of plasma membrane.\nThese studies showed that the cell membrane is mainly composed of\nlipids and proteins. The major lipids are phospholipids that are arranged\nin a bilayer. Also, the lipids are arranged within the membrane with the\npolar head towards the outer sides and the hydrophobic tails towards\nthe inner part.This ensures that the nonpolar tail of saturated\nhydrocarbons is protected from the aqueous environment (Figure 8.4).\nIn addition to phospholipids, membrane also contains cholesterol.\nLater, biochemical investigation clearly revealed that the cell membranes\nalso possess protein and carbohydrate. The ratio of protein and lipid varies\nconsiderably in different cell types. In human beings, the  membrane of the\nerythrocyte has approximately 52 per cent protein and 40 per cent lipids.\nDepending on the ease of extraction, membrane proteins can be\nclassified as integral and peripheral.

According to this, the quasi-fluid nature of lipid enables\nlateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to move\nwithin the membrane is measured as its fluidity.\nThe fluid nature of the membrane is also important from the point of\nview of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions,\nsecretion, endocytosis, cell division etc.\nOne of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is the\ntransport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeable\nto some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can move\nbriefly across the membrane without any requirement of energy and this\nis called the passive transport . Neutral solutes may move across the\nmembrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration\ngradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also move\nacross this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement of\nwater by diffusion is called osmosis. As the polar molecules cannot pass\nthrough the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they r\nequire a carrier protein of the\nmembrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ions\nor molecules are transported across the membrane against their\nconcentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Such",

Cilia are small structures which work like oars,\ncausing the movement of either the cell or the surrounding fluid. Flagella\nare comparatively longer and responsible for cell movement. The\nprokaryotic bacteria also possess flagella but these are structurally\ndifferent from that of the eukaryotic flagella.\nThe electron microscopic study of a cilium or the flagellum show that\nthey are covered with plasma membrane. Their core called the axoneme,\npossesses a number of microtubules running parallel to the long axis.\nThe axoneme usually has nine doublets of radially arranged peripheral\nmicrotubules, and a pair of centrally located microtubules. Such an\narrangement of axonemal microtubules is referred to as the 9+2 array\n(Figure 8.10). The central tubules are connected by bridges and is also\nenclosed by a central sheath, which is connected to one of the tubules of\neach peripheral doublets by a radial spoke. Thus, there are nine radial\nspokes. The peripheral doublets are also interconnected by linkers. Both\nthe cilium and flagellum emerge from centriole-like structure called the\nbasal bodies.\n8.5.9 Centrosome and Centrioles\nCentrosome is an organelle usually containing two cylindrical structures\ncalled centrioles. They are surrounded by amorphous pericentriolar\nmaterials. Both the centrioles in a centrosome lie perpendicular to each",

It is therefore, essential to have efficient mechanisms for the\nmovement of these substances to the cells and from the cells. Different\ngroups of animals have evolved different methods for this transport. Simple\norganisms like sponges and coelenterates circulate water from their\nsurroundings through their body cavities to facilitate the cells to exchange\nthese substances. More complex organisms use special fluids within their\nbodies to transport such materials. Blood is the most commonly used body\nfluid by most of the higher organisms , including humans , for this\npurpose. A nother body fluid, lymph, also helps in the transport of\ncertain substances.

Do you know why? Blood exhibits coagulation or clotting\nin response to an injury or trauma. This is a mechanism to prevent\nexcessive loss of blood from the body. You would have observed a dark\nreddish brown scum formed at the site of a cut or an injury over a period\nof time. It is a clot or coagulam formed mainly of a network of threads\ncalled fibrins in which dead and damaged formed elements of blood are\ntrapped. Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive fibrinogens in\nthe plasma by the enzyme thrombin. Thrombins, in turn are formed from\nanother inactive substance present in the plasma called prothrombin. An\nenzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for the above reaction. This\ncomplex is formed by a series of linked enzymic reactions (cascade\nprocess) involving a number of factors present in the plasma in an inactive\nstate. An injury or a trauma stimulates the platelets in the blood to release\ncertain factors which activate the mechanism of coagulation. Certain\nfactors released by the tissues at the site of injury also can initiate",

To begin with, all the\nfour chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in  joint\ndiastole.

This increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about\n30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by\nthe AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through\nthe entire ventricular musculature. This causes the ventricular muscles\nto contract,  (ventricular systole), the atria undergoes relaxation\n(diastole), coinciding with the ventricular systole.

As\nthe ventricular pressure increases further, the semilunar valves guarding\nthe pulmonary artery (right side) and the aorta (left side) are forced open,\nallowing the blood in the ventricles to flow through these vessels into\nthe circulatory pathways. The ventricles now relax (ventricular diastole)\nand the ventricular pressure falls causing the closure of semilunar valves\nwhich prevents the backflow of blood into the ventricles. As the\nventricular pressure declines further, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves\nare pushed open by the pressure in the atria exerted by the blood which\nwas being emptied into them by the veins. The blood now once again\nmoves freely to the ventricles. The ventricles and atria are now again in\na relaxed (joint diastole) state, as earlier. Soon the SAN generates a new\naction potential and the events described above are repeated in that\nsequence and the process continues.\nThis sequential event in the heart which is cyclically repeated is called\nthe cardiac cycle and it consists of systole and diastole of both the atria\nand ventricles.

Green plants, in fact,\nhave to make or rather synthesise the food they need and all other organisms\ndepend on them for their needs. The green plants make or rather synthesise\nthe food they need through photosynthesis and are therefore called autotrophs.\nYou have already learnt that the autotrophic nutrition is found only in plants\nand all other organisms that depend on the green plants for food are\nheterotrophs. Green plants carry out \u2018photosynthesis\u2019, a physico-chemical\nprocess by which they use light energy to drive the synthesis of organic\ncompounds.  Ultimately, all living forms on earth depend on sunlight for\nenergy.  The use of energy from sunlight by plants doing photosynthesis is\nthe basis of life on earth.  Photosynthesis is important due to two reasons: it\nis the primary source of all food on earth. It is also responsible for the release\nof oxygen into the atmosphere by green plants.

Priestley observed that a candle burning in\na closed space \u2013 a bell jar, soon gets extinguished\n(Figure 11.1 a, b, c, d).  Similarly, a mouse would\nsoon suffocate in a closed space. He concluded that\na burning candle or an animal that breathe the air,\nboth somehow, damage the air.  But when he placed a mint plant in the\nsame bell jar, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle\ncontinued to burn.

Glucose is usually stored as\nstarch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants\n(chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called\nchloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is\nwhere glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch.\nNow consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann\n(1843 \u2013 1909).  Using a prism he split light into its spectral components\nand then illuminated a green alga, Cladophora, placed in a suspension\nof aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of O 2\nevolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region\nof blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of\nphotosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption\nspectra of chlorophyll a and b (discussed  in section 11.4).\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant\nphotosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy\nto make carbohydrates fr\nom CO2 and water.  The empirical equation\nrepresenting the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving\norganisms was then understood as:\nCO H O CH O OLight\n2 2 2 2+ \uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7 + [ ]\nwhere [CH2O] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon\nsugar).",

When H2S, instead\nis the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the\n\u2018oxidation\u2019 product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism\nand not O2. Hence, he inferred that the O 2 evolved by the green plant\ncomes from H2O, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using\nradioisotopic techniques.

W e can\nlook for an answer to this question by trying to\nseparate the leaf pigments of any green  plant\nthrough paper chromatography. A\nchromatographic separation of the leaf pigments\nshows that the colour that we see in leaves is\nnot due to a single pigment but due to four\npigments: Chlorophyll aaaaa (bright or blue green\nin the chromatogram), \nchlorophyll b bb bb (yellow\ngreen), xanthophylls (yellow) and carotenoids\n(yellow to yellow-orange).  Let us now see what\nroles various pigments play in photosynthesis.\nPigments are substances that have an ability\nto absorb light, at specific wavelengths. Can you\nguess which is the most abundant plant\npigment in the world? Let us study the graph\nshowing the ability of chlorophyll a pigment to\nabsorb lights of different wavelengths (Figure\n11.3 a). Of course, you are familiar with the\nwavelength of the visible spectrum of light as\nwell as the VIBGYOR.\nFrom Figure 11.3a can you determine the\nwavelength (colour of light) at which chlorophyll\na shows the maximum absorption?

While the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I\nand PS II the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP\nreductase enzyme.

Carboxylation is the most crucial step of the Calvin cycle\nwhere CO2 is utilised for the carboxylation of RuBP.  This reaction is\ncatalysed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase which results in the formation\nof two molecules of 3-PGA.  Since this enzyme also has an oxygenation\nactivity it would be more correct to call it RuBP carboxylase-oxygenase\nor RuBisCO.\nReprint 2025-26",

In\nthe photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of\nATP. Rather it results in the release of CO2 with the utilisation of ATP. In\nthe photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH.\nThe biological function of photorespiration is not known yet.\nIn C4 plants photorespiration does not occur.

Photosynthesis is under the influence of\nseveral factors, both internal (plant) and external. The plant factors include\nthe number, size, age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and\nchloroplasts, internal CO2 concentration and the amount of chlorophyll.\nThe plant or internal factors are dependent on the genetic predisposition\nand the growth of the plant.\nThe external factors would include the availability of sunlight,\ntemperature, CO2 concentration and water.  As a plant photosynthesises,\nall these factors will simultaneously affect its rate. Hence, though several\nfactors interact and simultaneously affect photosynthesis or CO2 fixation,\nusually one factor is the major cause or is the one that limits the rate.\nHence, at any point the rate will be determined by the factor available at\nsub-optimal levels.\nWhen several factors affect any [bio] chemical process, Blackman\u2019s\n(1905) Law of Limiting Factors comes into effect. This states the following:\nIf a chemical pr ocess is affected by mor e than one factor , then its\nrate will be deter mined by the factor which is near est to its minimal\nvalue: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is\nchanged.\nFor example, despite the presence of a green",

Photosynthesis takes place\nonly in the green parts of the plants, mainly the leaves. Within the leaves, the\nmesophyll cells have a large number of chloroplasts that are responsible for CO2\nfixation.  Within the chloroplasts, the membranes are sites for the light reaction,\nwhile the chemosynthetic pathway occurs in the stroma.  Photosynthesis has two\nstages: the light reaction and the carbon fixing reactions. In the light reaction the\nlight energy is absorbed by the pigments present in the antenna, and funnelled to\nspecial chlorophyll a molecules called reaction centre chlorophylls. There are two\nphotosystems, PS I and PS II. PS I has a 700 nm absorbing chlorophyll a P700\nmolecule at its reaction centre, while PS II has a P680 reaction centre that absorbs\nred light at 680 nm.  After absorbing light, electrons are excited and transferred\nthrough PS II and PS I and finally to NAD forming NADH.

In the bundle sheath cells the Calvin pathway is carried\nout for the synthesis of carbohydrates.\nEXERCISES\n1. By looking at a plant externally, can you tell whether a plant is C3 or C4? Why\nand how?\n2. By looking at which internal structure of a plant you can tell whether a plant is\nC3 or C4? Explain.\n3. Even though a very few cells in a C4 plant carry out the biosynthetic \u2013 Calvin\npathway, yet they are highly productive. Can you discuss why?\nReprint 2025-26",

Such disease-\ncausing organisms are called \npathogens. Most parasites are therefore\npathogens as they cause harm to the host by living in (or on) them. The\npathogens can enter our body by various means, multiply  and interfere\nwith normal vital activities, resulting in morphological and functional\ndamage. Pathogens have to adapt to life within the environment of the\nhost. For example, the pathogens that enter the gut must know a way of\nsurviving in the stomach at low pH and resisting the various digestive\nenzymes. A few representative members from different groups of\npathogenic organisms are discussed here alongwith the diseases caused\nby them. Preventive and control measures against these diseases in general,\nare also briefly described.\nSalmonella typhi is a pathogenic bacterium which causes typhoid\nfever in human beings. These pathogens generally enter the small intestine\nthrough food and water contaminated with them and migrate to other\norgans through blood.

Innate immunity consist\nof four types of barriers. \nThese are \u2014\n(i) Physical barriersPhysical barriersPhysical barriersPhysical barriersPhysical barriers  : Skin on our body is the main barrier which\nprevents entry of the micro-organisms.

It is\ncharacterised by memory. This means when our body encounters a\npathogen for the first time it produces a response called primary\nresponse which is of low intensity. Subsequent encounter with the same\npathogen elicits a highly intensified secondary or anamnestic response.\nThis is ascribed to the fact that our body appears to have memory of the\nfirst encounter.\nThe primary and secondary\nimmune responses are\ncarried out with the help\nof two special types of\nlymphocytes present in our\nblood, i.e.,  B- lymphocytes and\nT-lymphocytes.\nThe B-lymphocytes produce an\narmy of proteins in response to\npathogens into our blood to fight\nwith them. These proteins are\ncalled antibodies. The\nT-cells themselves do not secrete\nantibodies but help B cells to\nproduce them.

In vaccination, a preparation of antigenic\nproteins of pathogen or inactivated/weakened pathogen (vaccine) are\nintroduced into the body. The antibodies produced in the body against\nthese antigens would neutralise the pathogenic agents during actual\ninfection. The vaccines also generate memory \u2013 B and T-cells that recognise\nthe pathogen quickly on subsequent exposure and overwhelm the\ninvaders with a massive production of antibodies. If a person is infected\nwith some deadly microbes to which quick immune response is required\nas in tetanus, we need to directly inject the preformed antibodies, or\nantitoxin (a preparation containing antibodies to the toxin). Even in cases\nof snakebites, the injection which is given to the patients, contain preformed\nantibodies against the snake venom. This type of immunisation is called\npassive immunisation.\nRecombinant DNA technology has allowed the production of antigenic\npolypeptides of pathogen in bacteria or yeast.

For determining the cause of allergy, the patient is\nexposed to or injected with very small doses of possible allergens, and the\nreactions studied. The use of drugs like anti-histamine, adrenalin and\nsteroids quickly reduce the symptoms of allergy.

Addiction is a psychological\nattachment to certain effects \u2013 such as euphoria and a temporary feeling\nof well-being \u2013 associated with drugs and alcohol. These drive people to\ntake them even when these are not needed, or even when their use becomes\nself-destructive. With repeated use of drugs, the tolerance level of the\nreceptors present in our body increases. Consequently the receptors\nrespond only to higher doses of drugs or alcohol leading to greater intake\nand addiction. However, it should be clearly borne in mind that use of\nthese drugs even once, can be a fore-runner to addiction. Thus, the\naddictive potential of drugs and alcohol, pull the user into a vicious circle\nleading to their regular use (abuse) from which he/she may not be able\nto get out. In the absence of any guidance or counselling, the person gets\naddicted and becomes dependent on their use.\nDependence is the tendency of the body to manifest a characteristic\nand unpleasant withdrawal syndrome if regular dose of drugs/alcohol\nis abruptly discontinued. This is characterised by anxiety, shakiness,\nnausea and sweating, which may be relieved when use is resumed again.\nIn some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be severe and even life",

You may wonder how a single cell then goes on to form such\nlarge organisms. Growth and reproduction are characteristics of cells,\nindeed of all living organisms. All cells reproduce by dividing into two,\nwith each parental cell giving rise to two daughter cells each time they\ndivide. These newly formed daughter cells can themselves grow and divide,\ngiving rise to a new cell population that is formed by the growth and\ndivision of a single parental cell and its progeny. In other words, such\ncycles of growth and division allow a single cell to form a structure\nconsisting of millions of cells.\n10.1 CELL CYCLE\nCell division is a very important  process in all living organisms. During\nthe division of a cell, DNA replication and cell growth also take place. All\nthese processes, i.e., cell division, DNA replication, and cell growth, hence,\nhave to take place in a coordinated way to ensure correct division and\nformation of progeny cells containing intact genomes. The sequence of\nevents by which a cell duplicates its genome, synthesises the other\nconstituents of the cell and eventually divides into two daughter cells is\ntermed cell cycle.

Interphase is further subdivided into G 1, S and G2. G1\nphase is the period when the cell grows and carries out normal metabolism.\nMost of the organelle duplication also occurs during this phase. S phase marks\nthe phase of DNA replication and chromosome duplication. G 2 phase is the\nperiod of cytoplasmic growth. Mitosis is also divided into four stages namely\nprophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Chromosome condensation\noccurs during prophase. Simultaneously, the centrioles move to the opposite\npoles. The nuclear envelope and the nucleolus disappear and the spindle\nfibres start appearing. Metaphase is marked by the alignment of chromosomes\nat the equatorial plate. During anaphase the centromeres divide and the\nchromatids start moving towards the two opposite poles.

Plants, unlike animals,\nhave no specialised organs for gaseous exchange but they have stomata\nand lenticels for this purpose.

How this is done is, essentially, the story of respiration.\nDuring the process of respiration, oxygen is utilised, and carbon\ndioxide, water and energy are released as products.

There are sufficient reasons to believe that the first\ncells on this planet lived in an atmosphere that lacked oxygen.  Even\namong present-day living organisms, we know of several that are adapted\nto anaerobic conditions.  Some of these organisms are facultative\nanaerobes, while in others the requirement for anaerobic condition is\nobligate.  In any case, all living organisms retain the enzymatic machinery\nto partially oxidise glucose without the help of oxygen.  This breakdown\nof glucose to pyruvic acid is called glycolysis.\n12.2 GLYCOLYSIS\nThe term glycolysis has originated from the Greek words, glycos for sugar,\nand lysis for splitting.  The scheme of glycolysis was given by Gustav\nEmbden, Otto Meyerhof, and J. Parnas, and is often referred to as the\nEMP pathway. In anaerobic organisms, it is the only process in respiration.\nGlycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and is present in all living\norganisms.  In this process, glucose undergoes partial oxidation to form\ntwo molecules of pyruvic acid. In plants, this glucose is derived from\nsucrose, which is the end product of photosynthesis, or from storage",

Hence, the\nrespiratory pathway comes into the picture both during breakdown and\nsynthesis of fatty acids. Similarly, during breakdown and synthesis of\nprotein too, respiratory intermediates form the link. Breaking down\nprocesses within the living organism is catabolism, and synthesis is\nanabolism.  Because the respiratory pathway is involved in both anabolism\nand catabolism, it would hence be better to consider the respiratory pathway\nas an amphibolic pathway rather than as a catabolic one.\nReprint 2025-26",

They represent extinct organisms (e.g., Dinosaurs).\nA study of fossils in different sedimentary layers indicates the geological\nperiod in which they existed.  The study showed that life-forms varied\nover time and certain life forms are restricted to certain geological time-\nspans.

In due course of time this\nvariant population outgrows the others and\nappears as new species. This would happen\nwithin days. For the same thing to happen in a\nfish or fowl would take million of years as life\nspans of these animals are in years.

They were hairy and walked like gorillas and chimpanzees.\nRamapithecus  was more man-like while Dryopithecus  was more\nape-like. Few fossils of man-like bones have been discovered in Ethiopia\nand Tanzania (Figure 6.11). These revealed hominid features leading to\nthe belief that about 3-4 mya, man-like primates walked in eastern Africa.\nThey were probably not taller than 4 feet but walked up right. Two mya,\nAustralopithecines probably lived in East African grasslands. Evidence\nshows they hunted with stone weapons but essentially ate fruit. Some of\nthe bones among the bones discovered were different. This creature was\ncalled the first human-like being the hominid and was called Homo habilis.\nThe brain capacities were between 650-800cc. They probably did not eat\nmeat.

The vectors provide the origin of\nreplication.\nFurther , not every detail of r eplication is\nunderstood well.  In eukaryotes, the replication of\nDNA takes place at S-phase of the cell-cycle.  The\nreplication of DNA and cell division cycle should be\nhighly coordinated. A failure in cell division after\nDNA replication results into polyploidy(a\nchromosomal anomaly). You will learn the detailed\nnature of origin and the processes occurring at this\nsite, in higher classes.\n5.5 TRANSCRIPTION\nThe process of copying genetic information from one\nstrand of the DNA into RNA is termed as\ntranscription . Here also, the principle of\ncomplementarity governs the process of transcription, except the adenosine\ncomplements now forms base pair with uracil instead of thymine.  However,\nunlike in the process of replication, which once set in, the total DNA of an\norganism gets duplicated, in transcription only a segment of DNA and\nonly one of the strands is copied into RNA.  This necessitates defining the\nboundaries that would demarcate the region and the strand of DNA that\nwould be transcribed.\nWhy both the strands are not copied during transcription has the\nsimple answer. First, if both strands act as a template, they would code\nfor RNA molecule with different sequences (Remember complementarity",

While DNA stores genetic\ninformation, RNA mostly helps in transfer and expression of information.\nThough DNA and RNA both function as genetic material, but DNA being\nchemically and structurally more stable is a better genetic material.\nHowever, RNA is the first to evolve and DNA was derived from RNA.  The\nhallmark of the double stranded helical structure of DNA is the hydrogen\nbonding between the bases from opposite strands. The rule is that\nAdenine pairs with Thymine through two H-bonds, and Guanine with\nCytosine through three H-bonds.  This makes one strand\ncomplementary to the other .  The DNA r eplicates semiconservatively,\nthe process is guided by the complementary H-bonding.  A segment of\nDNA that codes for RNA may in a simplistic term can be referred as\ngene. During transcription also, one of the strands of DNA acts a\ntemplate to direct the synthesis of complementary RNA.  In bacteria,\nthe transcribed mRNA is functional, hence can directly be translated.\nIn eukaryotes, the gene is split.  The coding sequences, exons, are\ninterrupted by non-coding sequences, introns.  Introns are removed\nand exons are joined to produce functional RNA by splicing. The\nmessenger RNA contains the base sequences that are read in a\ncombination of three (to make triplet genetic code) to code for an amino\nacid.

Growth can be defined\nas an irreversible permanent increase in size of an organ or its parts or\neven of an individual cell. Generally, growth is accompanied by metabolic\nprocesses (both anabolic and catabolic), that occur at the expense of\nenergy. Therefore, for example, expansion of a leaf is growth. How would\nyou describe the swelling of piece of wood when placed in water?\n13.1.1  Plant Growth Generally is Indeterminate\nPlant growth is unique because plants retain the capacity for unlimited\ngrowth throughout their life. This ability of the plants is due to the presence\nof meristems at certain locations in their body. The cells of such meristems\nhave the capacity to divide and self-perpetuate. The product, however,\nsoon loses the capacity to divide and such cells make up the plant body.\nThis form of growth wherein new cells are always being added to the\nplant body by the activity of the meristem is called the open form of growth.\nWhat would happen if the meristem ceases to divide? Does this ever\nhappen?\nIn earlier classes, you have studied about the root apical meristem\nand the shoot apical meristem.

This act\nleading to maturation is termed as differentiation. During differentiation,\ncells undergo few to major structural changes both in their cell walls and\nprotoplasm.

They also cause diseases in animals and plants.\nBut this should not make you think that all microbes are harmful; several\nmicrobes are useful to man in diverse ways. Some of the most important\ncontributions of microbes to human welfare are discussed in this chapter.\n8.1 MICROBES IN HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS\nYou would be surprised to know that we use micr obes or pr oducts\nderived from them everyday. A common example is the production of\ncurd from milk. Micro-organisms such as Lactobacillus and others\ncommonly called lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk and convert it\nto curd. During growth, the LAB produce acids that coagulate and\npartially digest the milk proteins. A small amount of curd added to the\nfresh milk as inoculum or starter contain millions of LAB, which at\nsuitable temperatures multiply, thus converting milk to curd, which\nalso improves its nutritional quality by increasing vitamin B 12. In our\nstomach too, the LAB play very beneficial role in checking disease-\ncausing microbes.\nThe dough, which is used for making foods such as dosa and \nidli  is\nalso fermented by bacteria. The puffed-up appearance of dough is due to\nthe production of  CO 2 gas.  Can you tell which metabolic pathway is\ntaking place resulting in the for mation of CO2? Where do you think the\nbacteria for these fermentations come from?  Similarly the dough, which",

A number of  traditional drinks and foods\nare also made by fermentation by the microbes. \u2018Toddy\u2019, a traditional\ndrink of some parts of southern India is made by fermenting sap from\npalms. Microbes are also used to ferment fish, soyabean and bamboo-\nshoots to make foods. Cheese, is one of the oldest food items in which\nmicrobes were used. Different varieties of cheese are known by their\ncharacteristic texture, flavour and taste, the specificity coming from the\nmicrobes used. For example, the large holes in \u2018Swiss cheese\u2019 are due to\nproduction of a large amount of CO 2 by a bacterium named\nPropionibacterium shar manii.  The \u2018Roquefort cheese\u2019 are ripened by\ngrowing a specific fungi on them, which gives them a particular flavour.\n8.2 MICROBES IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS\nEven in industry, microbes are used to synthesise a number of products\nvaluable to human beings. Beverages and antibiotics are some examples.\nProduction on an industrial scale, requires growing microbes in very large\nvessels called fermentors (Figure 8.4).\nReprint 2025-26",

These\nare removed in stages; initially, floating debris\nis removed by sequential filtration. Then the\ngrit (soil and small pebbles) are removed by\nsedimentation.

The effluent from the primary\nsettling tank is taken for secondary treatment.\nSecondary treatment or Biological treatment  : The primary\neffluent is passed into large aeration tanks (Figure 8.6) where it is\nconstantly agitated mechanically and air is pumped into it. This allows\nvigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into flocs (masses of\nbacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh like\nstructures). While growing, these microbes consume the major part\nof the organic matter in the effluent. This significantly reduces the\nBOD (biochemical oxygen demand)  of the effluent. BOD refers to\nthe amount of the oxygen that would be consumed if all the organic\nmatter in one liter of water were oxidised by bacteria. The sewage\nwater is treated till the BOD is reduced. The BOD test measures the\nrate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a sample of water\nand thus, indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present",

The type of the gas produced depends upon the\nmicrobes and the organic substrates they utilise. In the examples cited in\nrelation to fermentation of dough, cheese making and production of\nbeverages, the main gas produced was CO2.. However, certain bacteria,\nwhich grow anaerobically on cellulosic material, produce large amount\nof methane along with CO2 and H2. These bacteria are collectively called\nmethanogens, and one such common bacterium is Methanobacterium.\nThese bacteria are commonly found in the anaerobic sludge during\nsewage treatment. These bacteria are also present in the rumen (a part of\nstomach) of cattle. A lot of cellulosic material present in the food of cattle\nis also present in the rumen. In rumen, these bacteria help in the\nbreakdown of cellulose and play an important role in the nutrition of\ncattle. Do you think we, human beings, are able to digest the celluose\npresent in our foods? Thus, the excreta (dung) of cattle, commonly called\ngobar, is rich in these bacteria.

He completed graduate work at the University of Pittsburgh, in\n1963, followed by three years of post-graduate studies at Yale.\nIn 1966, Boyer took over assistant professorship at the University of\nCalifornia at San Francisco. By 1969, he performed studies on a couple\nof restriction enzymes of the E. coli  bacterium with especially useful\nproperties. Boyer observed that these enzymes have the capability of\ncutting DNA strands in a particular fashion, which left what has became\nknown as \u2018sticky ends\u2019 on the strands. These clipped ends made pasting\ntogether pieces of DNA a precise exercise.\nThis discovery, in turn, led to a rich and rewarding conversation in\nHawaii with a Stanford scientist named Stanley Cohen. Cohen had\nbeen studying small ringlets of DNA called plasmids and which float\nabout freely in the cytoplasm of certain bacterial cells and  replicate\nindependently from the coding strand of DNA. Cohen had developed\na method of removing these plasmids from the cell and then reinserting\nthem in other cells. Combining this process with that of DNA splicing\nenabled Boyer and Cohen to recombine segments of DNA in desired\nconfigurations and insert the DNA in bacterial cells, which could then\nact as manufacturing plants for specific proteins. This breakthrough was\nthe basis upon which the discipline of biotechnology was founded.",

Most likely, this piece of DNA would\nnot be able to multiply itself in the progeny cells of the organism.

This is because the alien piece\nof DNA has become part of a chromosome, which has the ability to\nreplicate.  In a chromosome there is a specific DNA sequence called the\norigin of replication,  which is responsible for initiating replication.\nTherefore, for the multiplication of any alien piece of DNA in an organism\nit needs to be a part of a chromosome(s) which has a specific sequence\nknown as \u2018origin of replication\u2019.

Therefore, alternative\nselectable markers have been developed which differentiate\nrecombinants from non-recombinants on the basis of their ability\nto produce colour in the presence of a chromogenic substrate. In\nthis, a recombinant DNA is inserted within the coding sequence of\nan enzyme, \u03b2 -galactosidase.  This results into inactivation of the\ngene for synthesis of this enzyme, which is referred to as insertional\ninactivation. The presence of a chromogenic substrate gives blue\ncoloured colonies if the plasmid in the bacteria does not have an\ninsert. Presence of insert results into insertional inactivation of the\n\u03b2\n-galactosidase gene and the colonies do not produce any colour,\nthese are identified as recombinant colonies.\n(iv) Vectors for cloning genes in plants and animals : You may be\nsurprised to know that we have learnt the lesson of transferring genes\ninto plants and animals from bacteria and viruses which have known\nthis for ages \u2013 how to deliver genes to transform eukaryotic cells and\nforce them to do what the bacteria or viruses want.

Similarly, the membrane is\nimpermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm.\nConsequently, the axoplasm inside the axon contains high concentration\nof K+ and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na+. In\ncontrast, the fluid outside the axon contains a low concentration of K+, a\nhigh concentration of Na+ and thus form a concentration gradient.

The electrical\npotential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as the\nresting potential.\nYou might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generation\nof nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus is\napplied at a site (Figure 18.2 e.g., point A) on the polarised membrane,\nthe membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na+. This leads\nto a rapid influx of Na+ followed by the reversal of the polarity at that site,\ni.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and\nthe inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membrane\nat the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potential\ndifference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called the\naction potential, which is in fact termed as a nerve impulse. At sites\nimmediately ahead, the axon (e.g., site B) membrane has a positive charge\non the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As a\nresult, a current flows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On the\nouter surface current flows from site B to site A (Figure 18.2) to complete\nthe circuit of current flow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, and\nan action potential is generated at site B.  Thus, the impulse (action\npotential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeated",

A synapse is formed by the membranes of a\npre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, which may or may not\nbe separated by a gap called \nsynaptic cleft. There are two types of\nsynapses, namely, electrical synapses and chemical synapses. At electrical\nsynapses, the membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons are in very\nclose proximity. Electrical current can flow directly from one neuron into\nthe other across these synapses. T ransmission of an impulse acr oss\nelectrical synapses is very similar to impulse conduction along a single\naxon. Impulse transmission across an electrical synapse is always faster\nthan that across a chemical synapse. Electrical synapses are rare in our\nsystem.\nAt a chemical synapse, the membranes of the pre- and post-synaptic\nneurons are separated by a fluid-filled space called synaptic cleft\n(Figure 18.3). Do you know how the pre-synaptic neuron transmits an\nimpulse (action potential) across the synaptic cleft to the post-synaptic\nneuron ? Chemicals called neurotransmitters are involved in the\ntransmission of impulses at these synapses. The axon terminals contain\nvesicles filled with these neurotransmitters.

In addition to these, some\nother organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract,\nliver, kidney, heart also produce hormones.\nA brief account of the structure and\nfunctions of all major endocrine glands\nand hypothalamus of the human body is\ngiven in the following sections.\n19.2.1 The Hypothalamus\nAs you know, the hypothalamus is the\nbasal part of diencephalon, forebrain\n(Figure 19.1) and it regulates a wide\nspectrum of body functions. It contains\nseveral groups of neurosecretory cells\ncalled nuclei which produce hormones.\nThese hormones regulate the synthesis\nand secretion of pituitary hormones.\nHowever , the hormones pr oduced by\nhypothalamus are of two types, the\nreleasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and\nthe inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones).\nFor example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing\nhormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of\ngonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus\ninhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones",

This reduces the\nblood pressure.\nThe juxtaglomerular cells of kidney produce a peptide hormone called\nerythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBC).\nEndocrine cells present in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract\nsecrete four major peptide hormones, namely gastrin , secretin ,\ncholecystokinin (CCK) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Gastrin\nacts on the gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric\nacid and pepsinogen. Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas and\nstimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions.

These hormones\nregulate metabolism, growth and development of our organs, the endocrine glands\nor certain cells. The endocrine system is composed of hypothalamus, pituitary\nand pineal, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, thymus and gonads (testis\nand ovary). In addition to these, some other organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract,\nkidney, heart etc., also produce hormones. The pituitary gland is divided into\nthree major parts, which are called as  pars distalis, pars intermedia and pars\nnervosa. Pars distalis produces six trophic hormones.

The transgenic\nplant therefore got itself protected from the parasite (Figure 10.2).\nFigure 10.1 Cotton boll: (a) destroyed by bollworms; (b) a fully mature\ncotton boll\n(b)\n(a)\nReprint 2025-26",

What would a diabetic patient do if enough human-\ninsulin was not available? If you discuss this, you would soon realise\nthat one would have to isolate and use insulin from other animals. Would\nthe insulin isolated from other animals be just as effective as that\nsecreted by the human body itself and would it not elicit an immune\nresponse in the human body? Now, imagine if bacterium were available\nthat could make human insulin. Suddenly the whole process becomes\nso simple. You can easily grow a large quantity of the bacteria and make\nas much insulin as you need.\nThink about whether insulin can be orally administered to diabetic\npeople or not.

This C peptide is not present in the\nmature insulin and is removed during maturation into\ninsulin.The main challenge for production of insulin using\nrDNA techniques was getting insulin assembled into a\nmature form. In 1983, Eli Lilly an American company\nprepared two DNA sequences corresponding to A and B,\nchains of human insulin and introduced them in plasmids\nof E. coli to produce insulin chains. Chains A and B were\nproduced separately, extracted and combined by creating\ndisulfide bonds to form human insulin.\n10.2.2 Gene Therapy\nIf a person is born with a hereditary disease, can a corrective therapy\nbe taken for such a disease? Gene therapy is an attempt to do this.\nGene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a\ngene defect that has been diagnosed in a child/embryo.

By introducing genes from other\nspecies that alter the formation of this factor and studying the\nbiological effects that result, information is obtained about the\nbiological role of the factor in the body.\n(ii) Study of disease: Many transgenic animals are designed to increase\nour understanding of how genes contribute to the development of\ndisease. These are specially made to serve as models for human\ndiseases so that investigation of new treatments for diseases is made\npossible. Today transgenic models exist for many human diseases\nsuch as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer\u2019s.\nReprint 2025-26",

The leaf is\nattached to the stem by the leaf base and may bear\ntwo lateral small leaf like structures called stipules.\nIn monocotyledons, the leaf base expands into a\nsheath covering the stem partially or wholly. In some\nleguminous plants the leafbase may become\nswollen, which is called the \npulvinus. The petiole\nhelp hold the blade to light. Long thin flexible\npetioles allow leaf blades to flutter in wind, thereby\ncooling the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf surface.\nThe lamina or the leaf blade is the green expanded\npart of the leaf with veins and veinlets. There is,\nusually, a middle prominent vein, which is known\nas the midrib. Veins provide rigidity to the leaf blade\nand act as channels of transport for water, minerals\nand food materials. The shape, margin, apex, surface\nand extent of incision of lamina varies in different\nleaves.\n5.3.1 Venation\nThe arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the\nlamina of leaf is termed as venation . When the\nveinlets form a network, the venation is termed as\nreticulate (Figure 5.4 b). When the veins run\nparallel to each other within a lamina, the venation\nis termed as parallel (Figure 5.4 c).

It is meant for sexual reproduction.\nA typical flower has four different kinds of whorls\narranged successively on the swollen end of the\nstalk or pedicel, called thalamus or receptacle.\nThese are calyx, corolla, androecium and\ngynoecium. Calyx and corolla are accessory\norgans, while androecium and gynoecium are\nreproductive organs. In some flowers like lily, the\ncalyx and corolla are not distinct and are termed\nas perianth. When a flower has both androecium and gynoecium, it is\nbisexual . A flower having either only stamens or only carpels is\nunisexual.\nIn symmetry, the flower may be actinomorphic (radial symmetry) or\nzygomorphic (bilateral symmetry). When a flower can be divided into\ntwo equal radial halves in any radial plane passing through the centre, it\nis said to be actinomorphic, e.g., mustard, datura, chilli. When it can be\ndivided into two similar halves only in one particular vertical plane, it is\nzygomorphic, e.g., pea, gulmohur, bean, Cassia. A flower is asymmetric\n(irregular) if it cannot be divided into two similar halves by any vertical\nplane passing through the centre, as in canna.\nA flower may be trimerous, tetramerous or pentamerous when\nthe floral appendages are in multiple of 3, 4 or 5, respectively.

In the hypogynous flower the\ngynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated\nbelow it. The ovary in such flowers is said to be superior, e.g., mustard,\nchina rose and brinjal. If gynoecium is situated in the centre and other\nparts of the flower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the\nsame level, it is called \nperigynous. The ovary here is said to be half\ninferior, e.g., plum, rose, peach. In epigynous flowers, the margin of\nthalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused\nwith it, the other parts of flower arise above the ovary. Hence, the ovary is\nsaid to be inferior as in flowers of guava and cucumber , and the ray\nflorets of sunflower.\n5.5.1 Parts of a Flower\nEach flower normally has four floral whorls, viz., calyx, corolla,\nandroecium and gynoecium (Figure 5.10).\n5.5.1.1 5.5.1.15.5.1.1 5.5.1.15.5.1.1 Calyx CalyxCalyx CalyxCalyx\nThe calyx is the outermost whorl of the flower and the members are called\nsepals.

In pea and bean flowers, there are five petals, the largest\n(standard) overlaps the two lateral petals (wings) which in turn overlap\nthe two smallest anterior petals (keel);  this type of aestivation is known\nas vexillary or papilionaceous.\n5.5.1.3 5.5.1.35.5.1.3 5.5.1.35.5.1.3 AndroeciumAndroeciumAndroeciumAndroeciumAndroecium\nAndroecium is composed of stamens. Each stamen which represents the\nmale reproductive organ consists of a stalk or a filament and an anther.\nEach anther is usually bilobed and each lobe has two chambers, the\npollen-sacs. The pollen grains are produced in pollen-sacs. A sterile stamen\nis called staminode.\nStamens of flower may be united with other members such as petals\nor among themselves. When stamens are attached to the petals, they are\nepipetalous as in brinjal, or epiphyllous when attached to the perianth\nas in the flowers of lily. The stamens in a flower may either remain free\n(polyandrous) or may be united in varying degrees. The stamens may be",

A carpel consists of three parts namely\nstigma, style and ovary. Ovary is the enlarged basal part, on which\nlies the elongated tube, the style. The style connects the ovary to the\nstigma. The stigma is usually at the tip of the style and is the\nreceptive surface for pollen grains. Each ovary bears one or more\novules attached to a flattened, cushion-like placenta. When more\nthan one carpel is present, they may be free (as in lotus and rose)\nand are called apocarpous. They are termed syncarpous when\ncarpels are fused, as in mustard and tomato. After fertilisation, the\novules develop into seeds and the ovary matures into a fruit.\nPlacentation: The arrangement of ovules within the ovary is known\nas placentation. The placentation are of different types namely,\nmarginal, axile, parietal, basal, central and free central (Figure 5.12).\nIn marginal  placentation the placenta forms a ridge along the\nventral suture of the ovary and the ovules are borne on this ridge\nforming two rows, as in pea. When the  placenta is axial and the\novules are attached to it in a multilocular ovary, the placentaion is\nsaid to be axile, as in china rose, tomato and lemon.

In coelenterates, the arrangement of cells is more complex. Here\nthe cells performing the same function are arranged into tissues, hence is\ncalled tissue level of organisation.

They are generally marine and mostly\nasymmetrical animals (Figure 4.5). These are\nprimitive multicellular animals and have cellular\nlevel of organisation. Sponges have a water\ntransport or canal system. Water enters through\nminute pores (ostia) in the body wall into a central\ncavity, spongocoel , from where it goes out\nthrough the osculum. This pathway of water\ntransport is helpful in food gathering, respiratory\nexchange and removal of waste. Choanocytes\nor collar cells line the spongocoel and the canals.\nDigestion is intracellular. The body is supported\nby a skeleton made up of spicules or \nspongin\nfibres. Sexes are not separate (hermaphrodite),\ni.e., eggs and sperms are produced by the same\nindividual. Sponges reproduce asexually by\nfragmentation and sexually by formation of\ngametes. Fertilisation is internal and development\nis indirect having a larval stage which is\nmorphologically distinct from the adult.\n*Echinodermata exhibits radial or bilateral symmetry depending on the stage.\nFigure 4.4  Broad classification of Kingdom Animalia based on common fundamental features\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 4.5 Examples of Porifera : (a) Sycon\n(b) Euspongia  (c) Spongilla\nReprint 2025-26",

Besides the fundamental features,\nthere are many other distinctive characters which are specific for each\nphyla or class.\nPorifera includes multicellular animals which exhibit cellular level of\norganisation and have characteristic flagellated choanocytes. The\ncoelenterates have tentacles and bear cnidoblasts. They are mostly aquatic,\nsessile or free-floating. The ctenophores are marine animals with comb\nplates. The platyhelminths have flat body and exhibit bilateral symmetry.\nThe parasitic forms show distinct suckers and hooks. Aschelminthes are\npseudocoelomates and  include parasitic as well as non-parasitic\nroundworms.\nAnnelids are metamerically segmented animals with a true coelom.\nThe arthropods are the most abundant group of animals characterised\nby the presence of jointed appendages. The molluscs have a soft body\nsurrounded by an external calcareous shell. The body is covered with\nexternal skeleton made of chitin. The echinoderms possess a spiny skin.\nTheir most distinctive feature is the presence of water vascular system.\nThe hemichordates are a small group of worm-like marine animals.

Although the term interbreeding implies sexual reproduction,\na group of individuals resulting from even asexual reproduction is also\ngenerally considered a population for the purpose of ecological studies.\nAll the cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood\ntrees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a\npond, are some examples of a population.  In earlier chapters you have\nlearnt that although an individual organism is the one that has to cope\nwith a changed environment, it is at the population level that natural\nselection operates to evolve the desired traits.

The size, in nature, could\nbe as low as <10 (Siberian cranes at Bharatpur wetlands in any year) or\ngo into millions (Chlamydomonas in a pond). Population size,  technically\ncalled population density (designated as N), need not necessarily be\nmeasured in numbers only. Although total number is generally the most\nappropriate measure of population density, it is in some cases either\nmeaningless or difficult to determine.  In an area,  if there are 200 carrot\ngrass (Parthenium hysterophorus) plants but only a single huge banyan\ntree with a large canopy, stating that the population density of banyan is\nlow relative to that of carrot grass amounts to underestimating the\nenormous role of the Banyan in that community. In such cases, the per\ncent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of the population\nsize.

It is concerned\nwith four levels of biological organisation-organisms, populations,\ncommunities and biomes.\nEvolutionary changes through natural selection take place at\nthe population level and hence, population ecology is an important\narea of ecology. A population is a group of individuals of a given\nspecies sharing or competing for similar resources in a defined\ngeographical area. Populations have attributes that individual\norganisms do not- birth rates and death rates, sex ratio and age\ndistribution. The proportion of different age groups of males and\nfemales in a population is often presented graphically as age\npyramid; its shape indicates whether a population is stationary,\ngrowing or declining.\nEcological effects of any factors on a population are generally\nreflected in its size (population density), which may be expressed in\ndifferent ways (numbers, biomass, per cent cover , etc.,) depending\non the species.\nPopulations grow through births and immigration and decline\nthrough deaths and emigration.  When resources are unlimited,\nthe growth is usually exponential but when resources become\nprogressively limiting, the growth pattern turns logistic.

Depending on the outcome,\nthese interactions between two species are classified as competition\n(both species suffer), predation and parasitism (one benefits and\nthe other suffers), commensalism (one benefits and the other is\nunaffected), amensalism (one is harmed, other unaffected) and\nmutualism (both species benefit).

In competition, it is presumed that the superior\ncompetitor eliminates the inferior one (the Competitive Exclusion\nPrinciple), but many closely related species have evolved various\nmechanisms which facilitate their co-existence.

This chapter introduces\nyou to the internal structure and functional organisation of higher plants.\nStudy of internal structure of plants is called anatomy. Plants have cells\nas the basic unit, cells are organised into tissues and in turn the tissues\nare organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in\ntheir internal structure.

Their structure and function would also be dependent on\nlocation. On the basis of their structure and location, there are three types\nof tissue systems.

Though the F1\nhave a genotype of Tt, but the phenotypic  character seen is \u2018tall\u2019. At F2,\n3/4th of the plants are tall, where some of them are TT while others are\nTt.

Hence the character T or \u2018tall\u2019 is said to\ndominate over the other allele t or \u2018dwarf\u2019 character.

That is, for example, whether a tall plant from F1\nor F2 has TT or Tt composition, cannot be predicted. Therefore, to determine\nthe genotype of a tall plant at F2, Mendel crossed the tall plant from F2\nwith a dwarf plant. This he called a test cross.

The\ninheritance of flower colour in the dog flower\n(snapdragon or Antirrhinum sp.) is a good example\nto understand incomplete dominance.

Since in\nan individual only two alleles can be present, multiple alleles can be found\nonly when population studies are made.\nOccasionally, a single gene product may produce more than one effect.\nFor example, starch synthesis in pea seeds is controlled by one gene. It\nhas two alleles ( B and b). Starch is synthesised effectively by BB\nhomozygotes and therefore, large starch grains are produced. In contrast,\nbb homozygotes have lesser efficiency in starch synthesis and produce\nsmaller starch grains. After maturation of the seeds, BB seeds are round\nand the bb seeds are wrinkled. Heterozygotes produce round seeds, and\nso B seems to be the dominant allele. But, the starch grains produced are\nof intermediate size in \nBb seeds. So if starch grain size is considered as\nthe phenotype, then from this angle, the alleles show incomplete\ndominance.\nTherefore, dominance is not an autonomous feature of a gene or the\nproduct that it has infor mation for.

Mendel found that the seeds resulting\nfrom the crossing of the parents, had yellow coloured and round shaped\nseeds. Here can you tell which of the characters in the pairs yellow/\ngreen colour and round/wrinkled shape was dominant?\nThus, yellow colour was dominant over green and round shape\ndominant over wrinkled. These results were identical to those that he got\nwhen he made separate monohybrid crosses between yellow and  green\nseeded plants and between round and wrinkled seeded plants.\nLet us use the genotypic symbols Y for dominant yellow seed colour\nand y for recessive green seed colour, R for round shaped seeds and r  for\nwrinkled seed shape.

They complete their life\ncycle in about two weeks, and a single mating could produce a large\nnumber of progeny flies. Also, there was a clea r differentiation of the\nsexes \u2013 the male and female flies are easily distinguis hable. Also, it\nhas many types of hereditary variations that can be seen with low\npower microscopes.\n4.3.3 Linkage and Recombination\nMorgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study genes\nthat were sex-linked. The crosses were similar to the dihybrid crosses carried\nout by Mendel in peas. For example Morgan hybridi sed yellow-bodied,\nwhite-eyed females to brown-bodied, red-eyed males and intercrossed their",

Morgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage\nof the two genes and coined the term linkage to describe this physical\nassociation of genes on a chromosome and the term recombination to\ndescribe the generation of non-parental gene combinations (Figure 4.11).\nMorgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped\non  the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (showed\nvery low recombination) (Figure 4.11, Cross A) while others were loosely\nlinked (showed higher recombination) (Figure 4.11, Cross B).

But if you\nlook around you will find that there are many traits which are not so\ndistinct in their occurrence and are spread across a gradient. For example,\nin humans we don\u2019t just have tall or short people as two distinct\nalternatives but a whole range of possible heights. Such traits are generally\ncontrolled by three or more genes and are thus called as polygenic traits.\nBesides the involvement of multiple genes polygenic inheritance also takes\ninto account the influence of environment. Human skin colour is another\nclassic example for this. In a polygenic trait the phenotype reflects the\ncontribution of each allele, i.e., the effect of each allele is additive. To\nunderstand this better let us assume that three genes A, B, C control skin\ncolour in human with the dominant forms A, B and C responsible for\ndark skin colour and the recessive forms a, b and c for light skin colour.\nThe genotype with all the dominant alleles (AABBCC) will have the darkest\nskin colour and that with all the recessive alleles (aabbcc) will have the\nlightest skin colour. As expected the genotype with three dominant alleles\nand three recessive alleles will have an intermediate skin colour.

Such a gene is called a pleiotropic gene. The\nunderlying mechanism of pleiotropy in most cases is the effect of a gene\non metabolic pathways which contribute towards different phenotypes.\nAn example of this is the disease\u00a0phenylketonuria, which occurs in\nhumans. The disease is caused by mutation in the gene that codes for the\nenzyme phenyl alanine hydroxylase (single gene mutation). This manifests\nitself through phenotypic expression characterised by\u00a0mental\nretardation\u00a0and a reduction in hair and skin pigmentation.\n4.6 SEX DETERMINATION\nThe mechanism of sex determination has always been a puzzle before the\ngeneticists. The initial clue about the genetic/chromosomal mechanism\nof sex determination can be traced back to some of the experiments carried\nout in insects. In fact, the cytological observations made in a number of\ninsects led to the development of the concept of genetic/chromosomal\nbasis of sex-determination.

In addition to recombination, mutation is another\nphenomenon that leads to variation in DNA.\nAs you will learn in Chapter 5, one DNA helix runs continuously from\none end to the other in each chromatid, in a highly supercoiled form.\nTherefore loss (deletions) or gain (insertion/duplication) of a segment of\nDNA, result in alteration in chromosomes. Since genes are known to be\nlocated on chromosomes, alteration in chromosomes results in\nabnormalities or aberrations. Chromosomal\naberrations are commonly observed in cancer cells.\nIn addition to the above, mutation also arise due\nto change in a single base pair of DNA. This is known\nas point mutation. A classical example of such a\nmutation is sickle cell anemia. Deletions and insertions\nof base pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift mutations\n(see Chapter 5).\nThe mechanism of mutation is beyond the scope\nof this discussion, at this level.

Progeny resembling the parents in morphological and\nphysiological features has attracted the attention of many biologists.\nMendel was the first to study this phenomenon systematically. While\nstudying the pattern of inheritance in pea plants of contrasting\ncharacters, Mendel proposed the principles of inheritance, which are\ntoday referred to as \u2018Mendel\u2019s Laws of Inheritance\u2019. He proposed that\nthe \u2018factors\u2019 (later named as genes) regulating the characters are found\nin pairs known as alleles. He observed that the expression of the\ncharacters in the offspring follow a definite pattern in differen t\u2013 first\ngenerations (F1), second (F 2) and so on. Some characters are dominant\nover others. The dominant characters are expressed when factors are\nin heterozygous condition (Law of Dominance). The recessive characters\nare only expressed in homozygous conditions. The characters never\nblend in heterozygous condition. A recessive character that was not\nexpressed in heterozygous conditon may be expressed again when it\nbecomes homozygous. Hence, characters segregate while formation of\ngametes (Law of Segregation).\nNot all characters show true dominance. Some characters show\nincomplete, and some show co-dominance.

Different combinations\nof gametes are theoretically represented in a square tabular form known\nas \u2018Punnett Square\u2019.  The factors (now known as gene) on chromosomes\nregulating the characters are called the genotype and the physical\nexpression of the chraracters is called phenotype.\nAfter knowing that the genes are located on the chromosomes, a\ngood correlation was drawn between Mendel\u2019s laws : segregation and\nassortment of chromosomes during meiosis. The Mendel\u2019s laws were\nextended in the for m of \u2018Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance\u2019. Later , it\nwas found that Mendel\u2019s law of independent assortment does not hold\ntrue for the genes that were located on the same chromosomes. These\ngenes were called as \u2018linked genes\u2019. Closely located genes assorted\ntogether, and distantly located genes, due to r ecombination, assorted\nindependently. Linkage maps, therefore, corresponded to arrangement\nof genes on a chromosome.\nMany genes were linked to sexes also, and called as sex-linked\ngenes.

Certain marine brown and red algae produce large amounts\nof hydrocolloids (water holding substances), e.g., algin (brown algae) and\ncarrageen (red algae) which are used commercially . Agar, one of the\ncommercial products obtained from Gelidium and Gracilaria are used to\ngrow microbes and in preparations of ice-creams and jellies. Chlorella,\na unicellular alga rich in proteins, is used as food supplement even by\nspace travellers. The algae are divided into three main classes:\nChlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae.\n3.1.1 Chlorophyceae\nThe members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The\nplant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usually\ngrass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The\npigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be\ndiscoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in\ndifferent species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies",

The first stage is the protonema stage, which\ndevelops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and\nfrequently filamentous stage.

In angiosperms, the seeds are\nenclosed in fruits. The angiosperms are an exceptionally large group of\nplants occurring in wide range of habitats. They range in size from the\nsmallest Wolffia to tall trees of Eucalyptus (over 100 metres). They provide\nus with food, fodder,  fuel, medicines and several other commer cially\nimportant products. They are divided into two classes : the dicotyledons\nand the monocotyledons (Figure 3.5).\nSUMMARY\nPlant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms\nand angiosperms. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing simple, thalloid,\nautotrophic and largely aquatic organisms. Depending on the type of\npigment possesed and the type of stored food, algae are classfied into\nthree classes, namely Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae.\nAlgae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation, asexually by\nformation of different types of spores and sexually by formation of gametes\nwhich may show isogamy, anisogamy or oogamy.\nBryophytes are plants which can live in soil but are dependent on\nwater for sexual reproduction. Their plant body is more differentiated\nthan that of algae. It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect and attached to\nthe substratum by rhizoids. They possess root-like, leaf-like and stem-\n(b)(a)",

By the process of leaching, water-\nsoluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated\nas unavailable salts. Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into\nsimpler inorganic substances.

They meet their energy and nutrient requirements by\ndegrading dead organic matter or detritus. These are also known as\nsaprotrophs ( sapro: to decompose). Decomposers secrete digestive\nenzymes that breakdown dead and waste materials into simple, inorganic\nmaterials, which are subsequently absorbed by them.\nIn an aquatic ecosystem, GFC is the major conduit for energy flow.\nAs against this, in a terrestrial ecosystem, a much larger fraction of energy\nflows through the detritus food chain than through the GFC. Detritus\nfood chain may be connected with the grazing food chain at some levels:\nsome of the organisms of DFC are prey to the GFC animals, and in a natural\necosystem, some animals like cockroaches, crows, etc., are omnivores.\nThese natural interconnection of food chains make it a  food web. How\nwould you classify human beings!\nOrganisms occupy a place in the natural surroundings or in a\ncommunity according to their feeding relationship with other organisms.\nBased on the source of their nutrition or food, organisms occupy a specific\nplace in the food chain that is known as their \ntrophic level.

Each ecosystem has\ncharacteristic physical structure resulting from interaction amongst\nabiotic and biotic components. Species composition and stratification\nare the two main structural features of an ecosystem. Based on source\nof nutrition every organism occupies a place in an ecosystem.\nProductivity, decomposition, energy flow, and nutrient cycling are\nthe four important components of an ecosystem. Primary productivity\nis the rate of capture of solar energy or biomass production of the\nproducers. It is divided into two types: gross primary productivity (GPP)\nand net primary productivity (NPP). Rate of capture of solar energy or\ntotal production of organic matter is called as GPP. NPP is the remaining\nbiomass or the energy left after utilisation of producers. Secondary\nproductivity is the rate of assimilation of food energy by the consumers.\nIn decomposition, complex organic compounds of detritus are converted\nto carbon dioxide, water and inorganic nutrients by the decomposers.\nDecomposition involves three processes, namely fragmentation of\ndetritus, leaching and catabolism.\nEnergy flow is unidirectional.

This process is\nclassification. Classification is the process by which anything is grouped\ninto convenient categories based on some easily observable characters.\nFor example, we easily recognise groups such as plants or animals or\ndogs, cats or insects. The moment we use any of these terms, we associate\ncertain characters with the organism in that group. What image do you\nsee when you think of a dog ?

It was done instinctively not using criteria that were\nscientific but borne out of a need to use organisms for our own use \u2013 for\nfood, shelter and clothing.  Aristotle was the earliest to attempt a more\nscientific basis for classification. He used simple morphological characters\nto classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals\ninto two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not.\nIn Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom  system of classification with\nPlantae  and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all\nplants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish between\nthe eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms\nand photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi)\norganisms. Classification of organisms into plants and animals was easily\ndone and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organisms\ndid not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classification\nused for a long time was found inadequate.  Besides, gross morphology\na need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure,\nnature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction,\nevolutionary relationships, etc.  Classification systems for the living\norganisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time.\nThough plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under all",

Once perfect (sexual) stages of members of\ndueteromycetes were discovered, they were often moved to ascomycetes\nand basidiomycetes. The deuteromycetes reproduce only by asexual spores\nknown as conidia. The mycelium is septate and branched.

Dmitri Ivanowsky (1892)\nrecognised certain microbes as causal organism of the mosaic disease of\ntobacco (Figure 2.6a). These were found to be smaller than bacteria\nbecause they passed through bacteria-pro of filters. M.W. Beijerinck\n(1898) demonstrated that the extract of the infected plants of  tobacco\ncould cause infection in healthy plants and named the new pathogen\n\u201cvirus\u201d and called the fluid as Contagium vivum fluidum (infectious living\nfluid).  W.M. Stanley (1935) showed that viruses could be crystallised\nand crystals consist largely of proteins. They are inert outside their specific\nhost cell. Viruses are obligate parasites.\nIn addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that could\nbe either RNA or DNA.  No virus contains both RNA and DNA.  A virus is\na nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious. In general, viruses\nthat infect plants have single stranded RNA and viruses that infect animals\nhave either single or double stranded RNA or double stranded DNA.\nBacterial viruses or bacteriophages (viruses that infect the bacteria) are\nusually double stranded DNA viruses (Figure 2.6b).

Whittaker proposed an\nelaborate five kingdom classification \u2013 M onera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and\nAnimalia. The main criteria of the five kingdom classification were cell structure,\nbody organisation, mode of nutrition and reproduction, and phylogenetic\nrelationships.\nIn the five kingdom classification, bacteria are included in Kingdom Monera.\nBacteria are cosmopolitan in distribution. These organisms show the most extensive\nmetabolic diversity. Bacteria may be autotrophic or heterotrophic in their mode of\nnutrition. Kingdom Protista includes all single-celled eukaryotes such as\nChrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime-moulds and Protozoans. Protists\nhave defined nucleus and other membrane bound organelles. They reproduce\nboth asexually and sexually. Members of Kingdom Fungi show a great diversity\nin structures and habitat.

One of the male gametes moves\ntowards the egg cell and fuses with its nucleus thus completing the\nsyngamy.  This results in the formation of a diploid cell, the zygote. The\nother male gamete moves towards the two polar nuclei located in the central\ncell and fuses with them to produce a triploid primary endosperm nucleus\n(PEN) (Figure 1.13a).  As this involves the fusion of three haploid nuclei it\nis termed triple fusion. Since two types of fusions, syngamy and triple\nfusion take place in an embryo sac the phenomenon is termed double\nfertilisation, an event unique to flowering plants.

In the flower,\nandroecium consisting of stamens represents the male reproductive\norgans and gynoecium consisting of pistils represents the female\nreproductive organs.\nA typical anther is bilobed, dithecous and tetrasporangiate.  Pollen\ngrains develop inside the microsporangia.  Four wall layers, the\nepidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum surround the\nmicrosporangium. Cells of the  sporogenous tissue lying in the centre of\nthe microsporangium, undergo meiosis (microsporogenesis) to form\ntetrads of microspores.  Individual microspores mature into pollen grains.\nPollen grains represents the male gametophytic generation.  The\npollen grains have a two-layered wall, the outer exine and inner intine.\nThe exine is made up of sporopollenin and has germ pores.  Pollen grains\nmay have two cells (a vegetative cell and generative cell) or three cells (a\nvegetative cell and two male gametes) at the time of shedding.\nThe pistil has three parts \u2013 the stigma, style and the ovary.  Ovules\nare present in the ovary. The ovules have a stalk called funicle, protective\nintegument(s), and an opening called micropyle.

The glandular tissue of each\nbreast is divided into 15-20 mammary lobes containing clusters of cells\ncalled alveoli (Figure 2.4). The cells of alveoli secrete milk, which is stored\nin the cavities (lumens) of alveoli. The alveoli open into mammary tubules.\nThe tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct. Several mammary\nducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla  which is connected to\nlactiferous duct and opens at the nipple, from where milk is expressed\nduring breastfeeding.\n2.3 G A\nMETOGENESIS\nThe primary sex organs \u2013 the testis in the males and the ovaries in the\nfemales \u2013 produce gametes, i.e, sperms and ovum, respectively, by the\nprocess called gametogenesis. In testis, the immature male germ cells\n(spermatogonia) produce sperms by spermatogenesis that begins at\npuberty.  The spermatogonia (sing.\n spermatogonium) present on the\ninside wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and\nincrease in numbers. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46\nchromosomes. Some of the spermatogonia\ncalled primary spermatocytes periodically\nundergo meiosis. A primary spermatocyte\ncompletes the first meiotic division (reduction\ndivision) leading to formation of two equal,\nhaploid cells called secondary\nspermatocytes , which have only 23\nchromosomes each.

What would be the\nnumber of chromosome in the spermatids?\nThe spermatids are transformed into\nspermatozoa (sperms) by the process called\nspermiogenesis. After spermiogenesis, sperm\nheads become embedded in the Sertoli cells,\nand are finally released from the seminiferous\ntubules by the process  called spermiation.\nSpermatogenesis starts at the age of puberty due to significant increase\nin the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). This, if you\nrecall, is a hypothalamic hormone. The increased levels of GnRH then\nacts at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates secretion of two\ngonadotropins \u2013 luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone\n(FSH).  LH acts at the Leydig cells and stimulates synthesis and\nsecretion of androgens. Androgens, in turn, stimulate the process of\nspermatogenesis.

The signals for\nparturition originate from the fully developed f oetus and the placenta\nwhich induce mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reflex. This\ntriggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary. Oxytocin acts on\nthe uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions, which in\nturn stimulates further secretion of oxytocin. The stimulatory reflex between\nthe uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in\nstronger and stronger contractions. This leads to expulsion of the baby\nout of the uterus through the birth canal \u2013 parturition. Soon after the\ninfant is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus. What do\nyou think the doctors inject to induce delivery?\nThe mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during\npregnancy and starts producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by\nthe process called lactation. This helps the mother in feeding the new-\nborn. The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called\ncolostrum which contains several antibodies absolutely essential to",

The male\nreproductive system is composed of a pair of testes, the male sex\naccessory ducts and the accessory glands and external genitalia. Each\ntestis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules, and each\nlobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules. Each\nseminiferous tubule is lined inside by spermatogonia and Sertoli cells.\nThe spermatogonia undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation,\nwhile Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the dividing germ cells. The Leydig\ncells outside the seminiferous tubules, synthesise and secrete testicular\nhormones called androgens. The male external genitalia is called penis.\nThe female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair\nof oviducts, a uterus, a vagina, external genitalia, and a pair of\nmammary glands. The ovaries produce the female gamete (ovum) and\nsome steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). Ovarian follicles in different\nstages of development are embedded in the stroma. The oviducts, uterus\nand vagina are female accessory ducts. The uterus has three layers\nnamely perimetrium, myometrium and endometrium. The female\nexternal genitalia includes mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora,\nhymen and clitoris. The mammary glands are one of the female\nsecondary sexual characteristics.\nSpermatogenesis results in the formation of sperms that are\ntransported by the male sex accessory ducts.

A normal human sperm\nis composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and tail. The process of\nformation of mature female gametes is called oogenesis. The\nreproductive cycle of female primates is called menstrual cycle.\nMenstrual cycle starts only after attaining sexual maturation (puberty).\nDuring ovulation only one ovum is released per menstrual cycle. The\ncyclical changes in the ovary and the uterus during menstrual cycle\nare induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones.\nAfter coitus, sperms are transported to the ampulla, where the sperm\nfertilises the ovum leading to formation of a diploid zygote. The presence\nof X or Y chromosome in the sperm determines the sex of the embryo.\nThe zygote undergoes repeated mitotic division to form a blastocyst,\nwhich is implanted in the uterus resulting in pregnancy. After nine\nmonths of pregnancy, the fully developed  foetus is ready for delivery.\nThe process of childbirth is called parturition which is induced by a\ncomplex neuroendocrine mechanism involving cortisol, estrogens and\noxytocin. Mammary glands differentiate during pregnancy and secrete\nmilk after child-birth. The new-born baby is fed milk by the mother\n(lactation) during the initial few months of growth.\nEXERCISES\n1.
